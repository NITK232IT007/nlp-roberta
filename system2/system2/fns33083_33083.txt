 Chairman s statement Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information Intu Properties plc Annual Report 2014 intugroup.co.uk Strategic report 7 Dividends Y our Directors are recommending a final dividend of 9.1 pence per share bringing the amount paid and payable in respect of 2014 to 13.7 pence unchanged from the bonus factor adjusted 2013 dividend. A scrip dividend alternative will be offered. Looking forward Over the last few years we have positioned ourselves for the upturn in the economy. I believe we are now beginning to see sustained though small improvements in disposable income generally responding to wage increases running ahead of inflation and lower fuel prices. Uncertainties and fragility remain and this is not confined just to the economic sphere some measure of caution is still therefore desirable. Retailers have also had a good end to 2014 which along with improved consumer confidence should see them growing their businesses. Through the enhancements we have been making to our centres in terms of the retail and leisure mix our world class customer service and our digital platform we are well placed to deliver a favourable trading environment for retailers. We will continue to build our business in Spain driving our developments there forward to replicate our successful UK model. We remain focused on delivering strong returns over the medium term through rental growth in our existing assets superior customer experience with seamless multichannel engagement and an increasing sense of personalisation showrooming and convenience. We believe that our active asset management and unique focus on creating the best possible customer experience will enable us to emerge as the leader of this trend among retail landlords. We recognise that the influence of digital technology will continue to dominate tactical and strategic decisionmaking across the industry. At Intu we see the rise of multichannel retail online instore click and collect as an opportunity rather than a threat. We have always striven to be at the forefront of technological advances and 2015 will be no different as we begin to develop further ways to utilise data gathered from our digital network.

We anticipate beginning construction this year. The catalyst for our other extensions the majority of which have planning approved will be the required level of tenant interest. We should not need additional equity to finance these projects. We can finance the extensions from existing available facilities raising debt against the value created from completed developments and recycling capital from other assets to reinvest into these growth opportunities including introducing partners into existing assets. The major developments are likely to be spread over a number of years so the proceeds from financing a completed project can be used to help finance the next one. Q Y ou have recently acquired a second centre in Spain. Why is Spain such an attractive market for you and why do you think you can replicate your strategy there A Spain has very attractive market dynamics with an economy moving out of recession and a sophisticated consumer and retail market but a retail sector where ownership of the regional shopping centre market remains highly fragmented and without a large committed pipeline of new centres. It is a country where we see major opportunities for us to broaden our presence and further strengthen our position in the market. We believe such expansion will be beneficial to our overall brand and digital positioning. The country holds huge potential for the creation of genuinely regional destination centres in which we specialise. Eighty per cent of Spains retail expenditure comes from 10 key catchments per cent. The ratio of rents to estimated sales for standard units reduced in the year to 12.5 per cent continuing the trend of the previous few years.

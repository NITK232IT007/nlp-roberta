Our sales The Discount market represents 16 of the overall tissue market and is the fastest growing sector at over 10 per annum. Accrols decision to focus on this sector in 2008 has delivered sales CAGR of 15.9 since 2013. Accrol is the market leader in the Discount segment with 50 share by market value. Technology and converting lines The Group currently has 17 converting lines in operation which includes 2 recently commissioned lines lines installed and recently announced the addition of a 3rd line which will be installed towards the end of 2018 as we seek to extend our reach into the Major Multiples. We also embarked on an ambitious plan to reorganise our warehousing and logistics operations creating a centralised finished goods hub next to the M58 in Skelmersdale Lancashire. This will enable us to better service our customers and prepare for future growth. Accrols founders the Hussain family have now fully exited the business in line with the strategy we set out at IPO and we have made a number of new senior management hires across the business. I would like to thank the Hussain family for a smooth and successful transition to new management. Strategy and outlook The continued oversupply of Parent Reels shows no sign of abating and as of January 2017 a further 111 tissue mills were on order or in their final stages keeping pricing competitive and supporting our strategy to procure Parent Reels versus own manufacture. We will continue to source reels from around the globe taking advantage of new technology and spare capacity. The majority of Private Label retail shelf prices for soft tissue are still at preEU referendum levels. There are positive signs that this is changing albeit slower than we expected and we expect the industry as a whole to pass on the effects of the weaker pound as currency contracts unwind. Peter Cheung Executive Chairman CONVERTING INVESTMENT INTO GROWTH Accrol Group Holdings growth strategy in FY17 was the implementation of a Supply Chain Optimisation plan to improve and simplify warehousing and logistics creating additional capacity for growth. A more efficient single big shed solution was adopted and a site quickly identified on the M58 at Skelmersdale in Lancashire. This 368000 sq ft warehouse is newly refurbished and will house finished goods and provide central distribution facilities to all UK customers. Warehouse management and national logistics will be contracted out to a 3rdparty provider NFT enabling the Accrol management team to focus on its core competencies of sourcing and manufacturing. People Following our IPO in June 2016 a new PLC Board was put in place and a review of our organisational structure was undertaken. Key gaps were identified and have subsequently been filled with highly experienced industry experts. The new team helped transition the Hussain family out of the business by October 2016 as agreed in a collaborative and controlled manner. People remain our most important asset and further investment continues to be made into their working environment through a focus on equipment and health and safety into their welfare through more employeefriendly rotating shift patterns and into respecting their views and opinions through employee engagement. Market opportunitiesoutlook The Directors believe that Accrols strategy remains relevant for the marketplace and that there continue to be opportunities for further growth. The move toward Discounters and OwnLabel will be accelerated as shoppers try to reduce the inevitable impact of inflation without compromising on quality. Despite for further Multiple contracts. We have also invested further in our Blackburn sites to enhance key lines train staff and implement a new employee friendly rotating shift system. This will increase our existing capacity by 12000 tonnes pa by October 2017. CAPABILITY Our Supply Chain Review was challenged with finding an optimal solution to match the growth ambitions and a Big Shed solution was presented to the Board in November 2016. The plan was to exit our current 6 warehouses and move to a simpler more efficient central distribution system. A 368000 sq ft. warehouse was found near Skelmersdale and NFT awarded a 5 year 60m contract in March 2017 to provide world class logistics and warehouse management. The transition of stock and distribution commenced during April and will be complete for August 2017. A combination of investment in new capacity at Leyland improving efficiency at Blackburn and adopting the Big Shed solution in Skelmersdale provides a robust platform for growth which matches the sales opportunity.

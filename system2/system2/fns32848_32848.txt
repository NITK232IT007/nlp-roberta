HOW WEVE PERFORMED Good progress was made through a combination of solid organic growth supplemented pleased to complete the acquisitions of Pro Mini Mix and Humberside Aggregates which expanded our service network and brought us additional reserves of valuable minerals. Our planned acquisition of quarries and an asphalt plant from Tarmac is an elegant means of acquiring additional reserves and asphalt capacity whilst simultaneously streamlining our readymixed concrete network. Q How do you maintain Breedons unique culture as you continue to grow A It is obvious that as the Group grows we need more robust processes. But that does not mean making those processes lengthier. We will keep our reporting lines short our central overhead to a minimum and devolve as much responsibility as possible to our managers giving them the training they need to assume accountability with confidence. Investment decisions will continue to be made quickly and we will remain close to our customers continuing to give them the outstanding service they have come to expect from us whether they are small local purchasers or one of the many major national concerns with which we are increasingly partnering. Q What are you doing about successionplanning A We decided very soon after the acquisition of Hope to restructure our management on Regional and Area General Manager lines in order to ensure that we had ambitious and capable people in those key roles on which the business depends. All our General Managers run substantial businesses in their own right and they provide us with an excellent pool of talent on which to draw in the future We are supporting them with significant investment in training and leadership development so that each of them is properly equipped to reach their full potential as future leaders of the business. Q What criteria do you use to decide how and where to invest in the business A We have always said that Breedon will expand through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. Acquisitions must be earningsenhancing bring tangible strategic benefits and deliver meaningful value for our shareholders. The same is true of organic investment we apply rigorous tests to every item of capital expenditure demanding a healthy rate of return and speedy payback. We also make decisions fast if the case for expenditure is strong and well presented we can give it approval within days or even hours. This approach has enabled us to deliver widespread performance improvements in our quarries and plants. 27 01 STRATEGIC REPORT 02 03 04 We have a business of significant scale and national reach with fully vertically integrated operations from cement production at the UKs largest plant to an extensive network of downstream product units. The addition of two cementitious import terminals has also opened up new strategic relationships with European producers which will potentially bring valuable benefits in the future. We have a tried and tested operational management team who have the experience and bandwidth to exploit new market and acquisition opportunities to the full in the years ahead backed by robust processes which ensure that we can move quickly when on a Fair Just culture which prioritises learning and accountability over blame and judgment. Among the safety improvements stemming from our VFL learnings in 2017 were the replacement of all powered anglegrinders with cordless battery models incorporating improved safety features and a move to cutlevel3 generalpurpose gloves to help prevent hand injuries. Pit covers were also fitted as standard to all workshop pits. Towards the end of the year we began the rollout of a new locallybased Site Improvement Plan scheme which will bring much greater discipline to the monitoring and improvement of operational and safety performance on each of our sites. 2.63 2.72 1.87 1.41 3.03 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 EMPLOYEE LTIFR EMPLOYEE TIFR 12MONTH ROLLING AVERAGE Jan 17.47 14.28 Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW CONTINUED 1.

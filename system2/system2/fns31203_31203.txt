 In addition my three executive colleagues visited our frontline operations on a regular and sometimes weekly basis. Hearing firsthand about operational issues and how they are impacting the experience of our customers helps us to refine our operations and strategic priorities. Regulation Each of our businesses is fully licensed by the FCA and we remain supportive of their efforts to maintain a rigorous regulatory framework ensuring the protection of consumers effective competition and a wellfunctioning market. We also welcome their recent HighCost Credit Review Update in which they note Consumers can benefit from using highcost credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems. 1 Whilst supportive of the FCAs objectives we believe that any potential gains from additional regulation must always be measured against the cost of achieving them. As well as executing the sometimes significant changes required of firms as part of the FCAs licensing process there has also been a near continuous flow of consultations indepth research and proposed regulatory changes that regulated firms have to address see An evolving regulatory landscape on page 28. Even for wellcapitalised groups such as NSF this adds significantly to both the regulatory burden and the uncertainty of managing a business in an evershifting regulatory landscape. Smaller firms may be less wellplaced to meet these demands and may look means that they can not repay this is not good for them or the agent. If circumstances do change and a customer perhaps needs some more time with their payments we are only too happy to work out a revised schedule that works for the customer and at no extra cost. Why are our APRs so high This is a question we often get asked. To answer it we need to explain what happens to the revenue we generate. The chart shown here illustrates what happens to NSF Group revenue based upon the 2017 normalised results. Whilst each of our three businesses has different dynamics we have sought to provide an NSF overview as follows Impairments Lending to customers with low or impaired credit ratings is a risky business and a significant proportion of revenue is lost through the impairment of loans that dont get repaid. Higher risk customers tend to result in higher impairments and so when lending to such customers lenders look to charge higher APRs. 1.6m An estimated 1.6m customers use home credit in the UK Source FCA. 53 Loans at Home grew its loan book before fair value adjustments by 53 in 2017. Our story People costs Staff and selfemployed agent costs are significant given the scale of our facetoface networks through which we engage with our customers either in a branch or in their home. In home credit temporary additional commission paid to newlyarrived agents is key to allowing them the time to build up example median hourly earnings for fulltime employees in 2017 was 14.00 therefore low pay employees are considered to be anyone earning below twothirds of 14.00 which is 9.33 ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 26 October 2017. 3 ONS UK Labour market May 2017. 4 Registry Trust Limited 12 March 2018. 5 FCA Understanding the financial lives of UK adults October 2017.

Such expansion required significant investment in training and incentives that are focused on rewarding both financial results and the delivery of good customer outcomes. Distribution networks we opened 12 new Everyday Loans branches in 2017 taking the total number now open to 53 we plan to open a further 12 in the first half of 2018. At Loans at Home we opened 22 new offices to support the rapid expansion of our selfemployed agent network and we now have 69 locations including the head office across the UK. Technology while facetoface contact lies at the heart of both branchbased lending and home credit all three of our business divisions rely heavily on 247 access to scalable and robust technology. With thousands of customers up and down the country effective data management and analysis ensures that we can process large volumes of transactions conduct full credit scoring and lead management and can monitor and optimise our daytoday business performance. Brands securing the trust and confidence of our customers and other key stakeholders is vitally important especially now that purchase decisions for financial services are increasingly made online or through remote channels. The quality of our service and size of our customer base means that continuing to invest in our brands and reputation is a source of substantial longterm value for the Group. 3.

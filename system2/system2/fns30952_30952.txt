Diabetes has been at the core of EKFs strategy for well over 10 years starting with the early models of the Biosen CLine and Biosen SLine glucose analysers. More recently HbA1c analysers have been launched that address the diabetes screening market. Although they do not strictly belong within a pointofcare framework clinical chemistry reagents such as strong performance from US distributors who have developed a market capitalising on the withdrawal of a previous method of testing for ketosis. More than 1000 US hospitals now use EKFs BetaHydroxybutyrate reagent. A similar approach is being used for Procalcitonin PCT in Europe where EKF has undertaken awareness activity using key opinion leaders in target markets.

Strategy The Group has continued to follow the path which led to the successful turnaround of the business in 2016 namely concentrating its activities on pointofcare diagnostics and the related central laboratory reagents business while reducing costs and simplifying the business. In the first half we closed our manufacturing site in Poland and transferred activities to our main European hub in Barleben Germany. This led to a small number of redundancies and we thank those affected and through hacking or other methods. This risk is mitigated by the use of robust security measures staff training and backup systems. The Group also has specific insurance cover. Review of strategy and business model The Board of Directors judge the Companys financial performance by reference to the internal budget which it establishes at the beginning of each financial year. EKFs strategy is to create a world class IVD business through organic growth. IVD has a wide spectrum and within this spectrum we have chosen to concentrate on pointofcare and our existing central laboratory business. We have identified and acquired businesses in these areas with strong product lines and distribution networks which can benefit from better more professional management greater resources and from the synergistic benefits of being part of a larger group. We sell worldwide to over 100 countries. In many territories we sell through local distributors 16 Annual Report 2017 EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 2.0 Corporate Governance however where appropriate we sell direct to end users which include hospitals laboratories and government agencies. Our distributors are supported by a network of regional sales managers and by product managers who are specialists in our product range. We manufacture the majority of the products we sell ourselves but also distribute a number of carefully chosen products on behalf of others. We have product support centres in the USA and Germany.

 While the plans were built bottomup we have been careful to align them topdown with group and divisional strategies. The multiyear plans are a first for Keller in a historically shortterm industry. In 2017 we worked on our customer feedback programme to expand our understanding and insights on more projects in more local markets. This improves our ability to spot trends in our performance and better target improvement programmes. Already we are seeing the benefit that our strong customer orientation and schedule adherence has on satisfaction scores. We have also been investing organically in strengthening our local branch network. Examples include Charlotte North Carolina USA Hamburg and Hannover Germany Cancun and Mexico City Mexico. These actions typically involve adding local sales and project management capability either in new or existing offices. Scale Leveraging the scale and expertise of the group Keller has globally leading expertise and a corporate structure that allows us to bring the best of Keller to every customer engagement. We will be investing in the tools and processes to make this more effective and efficient. Synergies in operating model will be selectively implemented so that we dont lose local responsiveness. Kellers scale provides security for customers and employees through resilience to risk. Our group level procurement capability has gained real strength and traction in the last year. For instance by combining our equipment buying power around the world we have signed new framework agreements with a number of suppliers improving financial and tendency to view women with ambitious character traits negatively compared to men. At times Ive found it difficult to be accepted by customers but over the years it has become easier in fact Id say that sometimes its been a positive. Id like to see us playing a more active role in searching for women at universities and promoting them challenging the established view that construction companies arent interested in female engineers. 34 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Sustainability continued Decent work and economic growth Our employees Keller employs around 10000 people worldwide most of whom are working in frontline roles meeting with and delivering for our customers.

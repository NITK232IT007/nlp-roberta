Treasury management The Treasury department provides a central service to group companies and conducts its operations in accordance with clearly defined guidelines and policies which have been reviewed and approved by the board. Treasury transactions are only undertaken as a consequence of underlying commercial transactions or exposures and do not seek to take active risk positions. It is Treasurys role to ensure that the group has sufficient available funds to meet its needs in the foreseeable future. To assist this we maintain rolling three to five year committed bank facilities totalling 175m which we periodically use to facilitate investment liquidity without holding permanent debt outside our investment portfolio.

 As the largest independent geotechnical engineering contractor in the UK it is our duty and priority to ensure the safety of our employees whilst at work. Our dedicated safety team undertakes regular internal audits of our procedures to ensure they are as comprehensive as possible highlighting any areas for improvement. As members of all the industrys best known certification and qualification schemes our systems are under constant review by external bodies promoting best practice. We are Network Rail Plant Operations Scheme POS providers and are active members of the Federation of Piling Specialists FPS and the British Drilling Association BDA. During 2008 we implemented our safety campaign Think Safety Act Safely. This has produced an increase in the reporting of hazards and near misses. This proactive approach has improved awareness and helped prevent accidents on our sites and in our yard and for other contractors working alongside us. This has contributed to an overall downward trend of reportable incidents in recent years. This improving trend faltered in the current financial year where we suffered several lost time accidents over the second half of the year. This remains a prime focus of the business and we expect the incident rate to return to its recent levels well below the industry average. All our engineers managers and directors are tasked with carrying out monthly compliance and safety audits. The safety scores are linked to our site teams performance results. Van Elle is an accredited CITB training provider to broaden the range of techniques and services it can offer and has identified several services including displacement piling and pulse piling which are not currently provided by the Group. By offering these complementary services the division will be able to bid on a wider range of contracts as well as capture additional revenue from larger and more complex construction projects.

The grouting work was carried out to stabilise old mine workings and consisted of 352 boreholes over 750 tonnes of PFA and 62 tonnes of cement. Although the foundations for the first three buildings were constructed using traditional piling techniques the most recent three structures required a rotary solution to advance beyond the coal seams. The extremely powerful LLamada P160TT CFA rig enabled us to install deeper larger piles than would otherwise be possible. This new capability meant that we could redesign the piles to carry the required loads and install them using a CFA solution 712 piles ranging from 400 to 500mm diameter and from 13 to 34m in depth significantly reducing both the programme duration and costs for our end client.

Financial review Delivering on our strategy Strong revenue growth of 11.8 to 94.1m Underlying EBITDA growth of 12.9 to 16.3m Underlying operating profit growth of 4.6 to 11.6m Excellent operating cash conversion at 92 Strong balance sheet with low levels of net debt and gearing Yearend cash balance stands at 12.9m Highlights 30 VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT The mix of revenue by our divisions is shown below 2017 000 2016 000 Change 2017 2016 General Piling 42905 42111 1.9 45.6 50.0 Specialist Piling 30126 25840 16.6 32.0 30.7 Ground Enging Services 10621 10151 4.6 11.3 12.1 Ground Enging Products 10441 6097 71.2 11.1 7.2 Revenue 94093 84199 11.8 100.0 100.0 The changing mix reflects our focus on growth markets as well as our ability to focus resources where we feel the best opportunities lie. We have targeted investment into several specialist rigs and equipment during the year and this will be our continuing strategy in the medium term. Our investment in our production capabilities has increased our capacity to meet demand from the housebuilders for Smartfoot modular beams and internal demand for precast piles the latter reducing our reliance on the supply chain. The returns can be seen in our growth in Ground Engineering Products revenues. Gross profit The gross margin of the Group has reduced slightly to 35.5 2016 36.1 reflecting sales mix changes due to reduced rail activity in Q4. The delay and is comfortable with the key assumptions applied and managements conclusion that no impairment has occurred. I look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September to answer any questions on the work of the Committee.

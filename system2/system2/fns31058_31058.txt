 The rapidity with which Hurricane has advanced Lancaster from the drilling and testing of the 7 and 7Z wells in late 2016 to a funded and approved FDP with target first oil approaching is unusual in the industry. Moving at this pace has allowed us to remain at 100 in our licences as we approach first cash generation. Dr David Jenkins H1 2 0 19 06 07 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Hurricane Energy plc Annual Report and Group Financial Statements Year Ended 31 December 2017 Hurricanes expertise lies in identifying and appraising fractured basement reservoirs. Our Business Model Prioritise health safety and the environment at all times Do things the right way never compromising safety or quality and implementing measures to protect the environment Technically driven Explore develop and produce our Rona Ridge assets Lancaster EPS provides reservoir knowledge to materially derisk the producibility of our Rona Ridge assets Focus on minimising finding and development costs to progress assets to a stage where significant uncertainties are removed Accept that maintaining higher licence interests than reflects the need for risk sharing between the service sector and producers. We are delighted with the working relationship with them they make money when we make money. There is no better incentive to be on time and on budget. We are not surprised to see this approach being replicated elsewhere. The Company implemented a new longterm incentive scheme in November 2016 the VCP. This scheme incentivises management to monetise the Companys reserves and resources against clearly defined milestones of financing exploration appraisal development production and potential sale. Management has delivered on a number of these milestones including drilling the Lancaster 7 and 7Z wells and raising funding for the EPS. Timely first oil and successful and safe operations should position the Company well to begin to monetise its assets and management are incentivised to bring this about. Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report. We are very aware that the environment West of Shetland is precious. Hurricane is dedicated to safe environmentally responsible and sound operations. As CEO I take personal responsibility for all environmental matters. Neil Platt COO takes the lead on all operational safety issues. We do not need to be financially incentivised to focus on these issues however any failures would have a significant negative impact on our annual and longterm remuneration. Hurricane went through a step change in 2017 we booked our first reserves increased our 2C Contingent Resources by 450 and obtained FDP approval on the first phase of development of our assets March 2018 and fabrication of the umbilical risers and flowlines remains on schedule. Following a programme of boulder relocation during 2017 ahead of schedule everything remains on track for summer 2018 installation. Hurricane has shown that it has an effective working relationship with Petrofac Facilities Management Limited and Transocean on previous drilling campaigns and is looking forward to using the Paul B. Loyd Jr. rig for well completions later this year.

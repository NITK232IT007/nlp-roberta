 The progress we have made so far in our transformation is largely due to the talented workforce we have at Oxford Instruments. I would like to thank all our employees for their positive response to the new strategy and the resulting changes their continued enthusiasm and their dedication to our customers. Outlook In a year of transition the Group delivered a stable performance supported by currency tailwinds. Whilst academic and RD funding levels remain uncertain we believe that progress with our strategic initiatives and favourable currency effects will deliver an outcome for the year in line with expectations. Our focus is on markets with longterm growth drivers where nanotechnology has the potential to address some of the worlds most complex and pressing challenges. Fundamental improvements to our structure operations and strategy are underway and give us a solid platform to return to sustainable growth at improved margins over the medium term.

Our products are used in conjunction with electron microscopes and ionbeam systems to provide the critical compositional structural and phase information that determines material properties from plastics through to advanced aerospace components and quantum devices. Our solutions are market leading being used in most of the worlds leading academic institutions and companies with applications ranging from renewable energy storage semiconductors advanced materials research mining metallurgy and forensics. NanoAnalysis continues to deliver a strong technical and financial performance in a relatively stable market. We continue to extend our range of products and have experienced particular success providing analytical systems supporting production in commercial applications such as data storage and automotive markets. In addition our flagship XMax Extreme product has delivered strong growth since its launch in the previous year with customers using its unique performance to undertake materials research at a resolution and sensitivity that was previously unobtainable. 1 Dr Mark Dineen and Mike Steel from Plasma Technology receive the High Volume Manufacturing award at the annual CS Industry Awards. 2 A training session for the Andor Dragonfly microscopy platform which resolves many of the barriers life science researchers face with conventional confocal microscopy.

We make extensive use of the intranet and recordings of key presentations which are made available across the Company. Many of our businesses hold Espresso meetings short informal presentations over coffee or lunch where topics of interest can be discussed. Examples of these presentations include a focus on new products and understanding our strategy. Suppliers and partners The Group recognises that relationships built on trust and respect with our business partners establish mutually beneficial relations. This includes our suppliers banks and collaborative associates. We have now started the initial roll out of our new ERP system which will offer a more efficient means to manage our supplier relationships including how we purchase materials and serve our customers. We perform regular inspections and audits and strategic reviews are in place for key suppliers. In accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 only quality approved organisations are used. There is a Group supplier management process in place that promotes a common supply chain strategy split by commodity driving the business towards fewer high level quality suppliers.

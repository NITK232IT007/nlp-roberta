0p. This means a final proposed dividend of 11.6p 2016 10.9p. This gives a full year dividend cover of 2.7x on underlying earnings in line with our intention to keep cover in the range of 3.75x to 2.5x. Board changes During the year we appointed Kevin Bradshaw as our Group CEO. Kevin has a background in both B2B and B2C organisations and he has a strong track record of developing businesses through clear strategic direction with a focus on consistent execution. He previously led Avis UK and more recently was CEO of Wyevale Garden Centres with both businesses enjoying strong profitable growth under his leadership. ANDREW PAGE I CHAIRMAN Northgateplc.com stock code NTG 25361.02 13617 Proof Four The way forward Our core objective is to grow shareholder value and we will do this by developing a business capable of delivering long term sustainable and growing cash flows achieved through a disciplined approach to deployment of capital and a rigorous focus on execution. Our touchstones will be cash flow and returns on investment. There is significant potential for Northgate with opportunities to develop the business and grow revenues and profits. In several areas of our business we need to do better with consistent and effective day to day execution. There is good demand for our product and services and we intend to harness this effectively through marketing clear customer propositions and ensuring we meet or exceed our customers expectations. There are also previously untapped market segments which identified four clear growth priorities in markets that are attractive and where we believe we have the ability to win. The fixed term opportunity is particularly exciting and we will build on our good progress this year which saw over 4100 vehicle contracts signed. As we further develop the strategies and implementation plans for these priorities I have significant confidence in the prospects for Northgate over the coming years. Kevin Bradshaw Chief Executive Officer Northgate plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2017 REVIEW 17 STRATEGIC REPORT 16 25361.02 13617 Proof Four FINANCIAL REVIEW Our objective is to build shareholder value by generating returns above our cost of capital. PADDY GALLAGHER I CFO Group Summary A summary of the Groups financial performance for 2017 with a comparison to 2016 is shown below 2017 m 2016 m Change m Change Revenue 667.4 618.3 49.1 7.9 Underlying operating profit 84.6 94.3 9.7 10.3 Underlying profit before tax 75.0 82.9 7.9 9.6 Underlying EPS 47.3p 49.0p 1.7p 3.5 Dividend per share 17.3p 16.0p 1.3p 8.1 Underlying free cash flow 44.0 48.4 4.4 9.0 On a statutory basis operating profit was 81.5m 2016 90.6m and profit before tax was 72.2m 2016 77.6m. Basic earnings per share were 45.7p 2016 46.1p. Net cash generated from operations including net capital expenditure on vehicles for hire was 47.8m 2016 73.7m. Group revenue increased by 7.9 to 667.4m or 2.7 at constant exchange rates. The weakened Sterling across the year increased profit before tax bad debts. Demand for our products and the cost of our supplies may be impacted by the UKs decision to leave the EU. If our pricing is perceived to be higher than our competition for the same level of service then we will either lose market share or be forced to reduce prices to remain competitive. Without any adjustment to the cost base this will result in an erosion of returns. An increase in holding costs if not recovered through hire rate increases would adversely affect profitability shareholder returns and cash generation. Failure to invest in our workforce and high levels of staff turnover will impact upon customer service and delivery of the Groups strategic objectives. Our recruitment processes seek to attract individuals who will exemplify our core values. Each new joiner receives an introduction to the Groups culture as well as our processes. Failures in health and safety would put the reputation of the business at risk both in terms of attracting and retaining talent and maintaining customer relationships. Should IT systems not be invested in adequately or fail whether the cause is accidental or malicious this could have an adverse impact on the recording and processing of financial information efficiency of operations and customer service delivery. Failure to maintain or extend access to credit facilities could impact on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. RISK IMPACT BEFORE MITIGATION CONTINUED Northgateplc.com stock code NTG 25361.02 13617 Proof Four Should there be a significant economic downturn the market improves. Personal development plans and tailored training are conducted for all employees. Salaries are benchmarked against the market and a range of incentives are provided to attract and retain staff. Succession plans are in place for executive positions. Regular communication and engagement with everyone across the business is vital to our success. The Group Health Safety and Environment and Group Internal Audit functions are responsible for delivering health and safety best practice and reporting any non compliance to the Board. The Group has an appropriate business continuity plan in the event of disruption arising from an IT systems failure. Before any material system changes are implemented a project plan is approved by the Board. A member of the executive team will then sponsor the project and an ongoing implementation review will be performed by external consultants. The objective is always to minimise the risk of business disruption that could result from changes. The Groups main facilities mature in 2020 and 2022 and the Group believes that these facilities provide adequate resources for present requirements. The Group reviews its compliance with covenants on a monthly basis in conjunction with cash flow forecasts to ensure ongoing compliance. The impact of access to capital on the wider risk of going concern is considered on page 24 and within the viability statement on page 33.

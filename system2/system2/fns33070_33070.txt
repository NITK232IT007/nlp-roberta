 The acquisition is expected to provide further impetus to our goal to be the bestinclass provider of financial content electronic transactions and distribution to market participants and to strengthen our recentlyannounced effort to add trading capabilities to Reuters desktops especially in the fixed income markets where the substantial Telerate client base would benefit our growing trading community. We are uniquely placed to achieve cost synergies from the acquisition because Telerates information distribution infrastructure already operates on our systems. Both transactions are anticipated to complete in mid2005 subject to regulatory approvals for the Telerate acquisition and other customary conditions. For more information see pages 20 and 89. 03 OUR MARKETS DRIVE OUR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE At Reuters we operate our business through our four Customer Segments which are closely aligned with the user communities they serve.

Our ability to realise the potential of these assets determines the extent to which we can achieve our strategic goals. Brand The starting point for growth the University of Michigan for the development and delivery of leadership development programmes. We regularly undertake employee surveys to evaluate morale and to identify any employee issues that need to be addressed. These surveys measure opinion in a number of key areas including leadership customer orientation performance culture and career development. Despite the challenges of Fast Forward the survey showed an improvement in overall employee engagement in 2004. The results are communicated to employees. We place a strong emphasis on communicating with our employees and won a Communicators in Business award for excellence in employee communications during 2004. We want to ensure that everyone in Reuters has a fair opportunity to contribute to our business and in 2004 we established a Global Diversity Advisory Council chaired by the CEO to advise on diversity issues and to help drive related initiatives.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued 22 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20F 2004 FOREIGN EXCHANGE Almost 90 of Group revenue is denominated in nonsterling currencies. The Group also has significant costs denominated in foreign currencies with a different mix from revenue. Group profits are therefore exposed to currency fluctuations. The approximate proportions of operating profit excluding goodwill amortisation and currency gains received in each key currency group were as follows Year to 31 December 2004 2003 2002 Adjusted Group operating profit by currency Euro 137 171 296 US dollar 8 5 71 Japanese yen 28 32 53 Sterling 103 133 283 Other 30 35 105 Total 100 100 100 Sterling costs exceeded sterling revenue due to the level of restructuring costs and UKbased marketing development operational and central services costs. In broad terms using the 2004 mix of profits the impact of an additional unilateral 1 strengthening of sterling would have been a reduction of approximately 5 million in operating profits before hedging 2003 4 million 2002 7 million. Exchange rate movements in 2004 had an 8 million net impact on operating profit.

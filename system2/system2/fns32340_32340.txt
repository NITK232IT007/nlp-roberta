Through Project This year sadly safety has been brought into the sharpest focus for all of us. A National Grid employee died following an incident at our East Claydon substation. We have undertaken a detailed internal investigation to establish exactly how and why this happened and to learn all possible lessons from it.

We received good news in July that New Hampshire regulators had approved construction of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project MVRP a 24.4 mile 345 kV overhead transmission line that will run in existing utility rightsofway between Londonderry New Hampshire and Tewksbury Massachusetts. The MVRP addresses the concerns of New Englands independent system operator ISONew England relating to ageing infrastructure and anticipated increases in electricity demand. In January we assumed primary responsibility for developing the Vermont Green Line VGL project. VGL is a proposed 400 MW HVDC electricity transmission project designed to unlock and deliver reliable and affordable renewable energy to New England. In August we withdrew our petition for capacity on the Access Northeast ANE gas pipeline after the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Massachusetts electric companies could not charge their between boys and girls. We participate in the annual Big Bang Fair which is designed to promote interest in STEM subjects and careers.

Being good neighbours When someone does a great job the company they work for needs to know and thats why Im writing to you. Ron Lamb Rhode Island When we lost electricity in my neighbourhood in Rhode Island I called to report the outage and then went to bed. I woke up at 330am and noticed we still didnt have electricity so I went downstairs to check the National Grid website which showed a crew was assigned and the estimated time electricity would be back on was 800am. I looked out of the front window to find a large crew of workers trucks and equipment. The thing that amazed me was this crew was going about doing their jobs making very little noise I would never have known they were there. At 630am one of the guys came to tell us theyd repaired the cable and he brought me my newspaper so I emailed to say thanks for being a good neighbour. 30 National Grid Annual Report and Accounts 201617 Strategic Report Our NG and the ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NGG.

These schemes coupled with exciting enquiries means that we are set to have a successful 2018. We have plenty of opportunities available to us as the market is relatively settled and should be able to support our planned growth. Both the student accommodation sector and residential markets are still strong with regular opportunities being received. Equally enquiries from the health sector are still encouraging and university funding for site development is still at a high enabling us to target schemes in both areas. Outlook for 2018 Our intention is to strengthen our brand within the construction marketplace to ensure our offering is visible to all our customers to encourage new opportunities and repeat business. We continue to foster relationships with developers operating locally including a series of opportunities with our joint venture partner Earl and Pelham Limited across the region.

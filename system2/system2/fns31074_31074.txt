 In April we established a transformational partnership with AstraZeneca for COPD products Tudorza and Duaklir. Under the terms of the agreement we promote Tudorza direct to physicians while AstraZeneca is responsible for manufacturing supply pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities. The partnership is progressing well. During the year Tudorza achieved compelling positive results in a largescale post marketing study and the products prescription levels are well ahead of the trend established prior to Circassias involvement. In addition Duaklir completed its US clinical development programme achieving positive phase III results and awaits filing in Q2 2018. CIRAR17frontv18.indd 19 25042018 1919 Operating review NIOX asthma management products Fractional exhaled nitric oxide FeNO is an important biomarker of underlying Th2 airway inflammation and its measurement is increasingly recognised as a valuable component of asthma diagnosis and management. NIOX is the leading pointofcare FeNO testing system available across major markets and the current VERO generation is sold in a large number of countries including in the US Europe Japan and China. Strong sales performance NIOX revenues continued to grow strongly during 2017 increasing 18 to 27 .3 million 12 at CER. Sales for clinical use ie excluding sales to pharmaceutical companies for use in clinical trials increased at a faster rate growing 26 worldwide 20 at CER 34 in the United States 27 at CER and 44 in China 36 at CER. In the UK revenues more than doubled compared with 2016 increasing 134 during the AMPLIFY in which it met both coprimary efficacy endpoints achieving significant lung function improvements compared with the individual LAMA and LABA components. Additionally a substudy of 24hour bronchodilation showed that twicedaily products Duaklir and Tudorza demonstrated significantly greater nighttime bronchodilation than oncedaily Spiriva. These positive results were supported by data from the ACHIEVE doseranging study which showed Duaklir contains the optimal dose of formoterol. AstraZeneca plans to incorporate these clinical studies in a New Drug Application NDA for Duaklir which it intends to submit to the FDA in the first half of 2018. Duaklir targets a significant market opportunity with thirdparty estimates suggesting annual peak sales potential of over 180 million. Commercial platform expansion In 2017 our newlyexpanded US commercial platform was an important factor in attracting AstraZeneca as a partner. In the coming year we intend to pursue this strategy beyond the United States expanding our infrastructure to drive NIOX growth and facilitate further inlicensing partnering or product acquisition. To lead this expansion we recently recruited the Head of Commercial Operations Asia Pacific from Takeda who has taken up the newlycreated role of Senior Vice President Commercial for Europe and Rest of World. As part of our expansion strategy we recently initiated a recruitment campaign in China and established a local subsidiary alongside our existing representative office. In the coming weeks we plan to increase our Beijingbased team which currently manages local distributors and establish a commercial back office. This will be complemented by a team of sales managers 77.5 4 50.1 104.7 Research and development 15.3 17.3 82.1 0.5 97.4 17.8 5.6 28.4 4 103.0 46.2 Administrative expenditure 11.0 14.6 0.1 0.3 10.9 14.9 0.2 0.8 11.1 15.7 EBITDA 34.7 38.5 45.0 1.0 79.7 39.5 6.3 31.9 86.0 71.4 Operating loss 39.6 43.8 82.0 1.0 121.6 44.8 6.3 106.7 127.9 151.5 Other lossesgains 1.1 5.2 11.5 10.4 5.2 10.4 5.2 Share of lossprofit of joint venture 0.2 0.6 0.2 0.6 Finance income net 0.3 0.8 2.7 2.4 0.8 2.4 0.8 Loss before tax 40.4 37.8 73.2 1.0 113.6 38.8 6.5 106.1 120.1 144.9 Taxation 3.5 1.9 16.5 20.0 1.9 1.0 5.6 21.0 7.5 Loss for the financial year 36.9 35.9 56.7 1.0 93.6 36.9 5.5 100.5 99.1 137.4 Cash 3 59.5 117.4 1 Disclosed as a single amount in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 2 Restated to show the results of the allergy business in discontinued operations see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 3 Includes cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits. 4 Sales and marketing expenditure includes 74.5m goodwill impairment and research and development includes 0.3m intangible assets impairment.

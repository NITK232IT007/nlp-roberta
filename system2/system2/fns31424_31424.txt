Supply of capital still at all time highs Despite the hurricane losses at year end 2017 global reinsurer capital again reached a record high according to Aon Benfield of 605bn increasing by 2 on year end 2016. Alternative capital grew by 10 to 89bn principally reflecting additional deployment into collateralised reinsurance structures as investors reloaded capital following the hurricane losses.

Alternative capital has increased significantly in the past ten years with assets under management of the ILS fund managers 2017 combined ratio excluding prior year releases and major losses being only marginally profitable at 98.4. This demonstrates the compounding effect of rate reductions for the previous four to five years. On the same basis Lloyds combined ratio was 87.8 in 2011 and 83.8 in 2005 the two most recent above average catastrophe loss years before 2017. Analysis by leading US analyst VJ Dowling suggests that we are now in the cheating phase of the cycle over distribution from prior years. Despite this AM Best reports that it expects US companies to release 4.6bn from reserves in 2017. The last period when US companies were boosting reserves declaring prior years losses was 2000 to 2005. Commercial lines which include other liability are where reserve weakness is evident with Aons annual Industry Reserve Study estimating that commercial lines had an overall reserve deficiency of 4.2bn at year end 2016 compared with its estimate of a 1.8bn reserve deficiency at year end 2015. Reserving concerns on US liability business is likely to be the reason for liability rate increases being higher than expected so far in 2018. The rating environment The final quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 has marked a change in trend with market conditions in most classes of business moving from a prolonged period of rate reductions to modestly positive rate increases combined with growing exposures benefiting in particular from a solid US economy.

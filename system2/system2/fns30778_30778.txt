 A more meaningful metric is the cash margin per hour which rose in the year by 1.2. The increase in margin per hour reflects the increased scale and diversity of our customer base. The above factors resulted in gross margin increasing by 7.8 from 61.3m to 66.1m. During the year we invested heavily within Recruitment specifically on IT infrastructure and new senior talent which saw overheads rise by 7.9 the net result of which is that underlying operating profit before finance charges increased by 7.4 to 20.2m 2016 18.8m. We continue to generate significant opportunities for the Group to build market share in our core business underpinned by our rigid adherence to compliance ethical approach and ability to deliver to our customers. Customers are increasingly looking for suppliers with scale and added value products such as worker retention models apprenticeships and bespoke training. This has meant that we have continued to win new business in line with prior year levels of growth. The number of OnSite locations from which we operate grew by net 38 ending the period with a total of 395 locations. 14 of those wins were within our core OnSite divisions with 17 in our newer divisions Agriculture Driving Ireland and seven acquired with Brightwork. This demonstrates that Stafflines geographical and operational scale means we remain the goto supplier across most industry sectors. The ongoing uncertainty around the final Brexit outcome has had an impact on UK consumer spend specifically within the fashion and food sectors. This has made supermarket and highstreet store demand volatile. As a result our growth in these areas has slowed down. This has meant that our 10 organic growth has been achieved through new customers in both the core and newer divisions. For example our largest singlesite customer by volume was a brand new Staffline customer in 2016 where our business has continued to grow in 2017 due to our excellent service levels. The uncertainty around the final Brexit outcome has also seen a reduction in the number of EU citizens coming to the UK and an increase in those returning to their homelands. In addition UK unemployment rates at 42year lows have impacted on our ability to attract candidates. However our scale of operations our excellence in both candidate attraction and retention and our ability to offer additional training through PeoplePlus have meant that we have been able to mitigate any temporary shortfalls in available candidates. As we face the challenges of a tightening labour market and the competition for talent intensifies we are placing even greater emphasis on the job seeker experience. Customer experience and employee engagement are at the heart of our business model and job seekers are increasingly choosing Staffline due to the emphasis we place on using our scale for good. By using our vast network and resources to provide fast flexible and longterm employment across thousands of roles we offer applicants unprecedented choice and variety of work during 2017 a clear reflection of the very high quality of our training provision. Business performance has been strong with growth in existing contracts following the government retender and our ability to deliver against these remains high positioning us well for further growth. We were awarded over 10m of new Adult Education Budget funding during the year. Our Independent Living Services ILS and Carers Hubs have continued to perform well with ILS managing 40m of direct payments from councils on behalf of local care recipients enabling them to live more independently. With demand on adult social care growing and representing a challenging budget area for local authorities we continue to seek opportunities to further develop our services in this area. Our focus on new business has allowed us to secure 54m 2016 13m of new business in 2017 with an improved win rate of 1 in 3 2016 1 in 6. This includes 24m for Fair Start Scotland the Scottish Governments key employability programme which commences in April 2018 and New Enterprise Allowance 2 at 9m which supports individuals wishing to start in selfemployment.

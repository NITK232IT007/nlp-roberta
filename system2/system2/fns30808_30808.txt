The programme includes ambitious structural reforms to generate higher and more inclusive growth and fully supports Governments fourpoint reform programme focusing on improving education investing in infrastructure making public administration more efficient and further developing the business environment to boost the private sector as a growth engine. In September 2017 Moodys upgraded the sovereign credit rating of Georgia to Ba2 from Ba3 and maintained the stable outlook. According to Moodys the Georgian economys resilience in the wake of the 2014 regional economic shock proves the countrys economic and institutional strength and is the main driver behind the onenotch rating upgrade. Government focuses on addressing the shortcomings in employment benefit schemes further cutting nonessential expenditures consolidating public sector institutions making social and healthcare spending more targeted and increasing the efficiencies in capital expenditure. In order to enhance external sustainability National Bank of Georgia introduced a ten point dedollarisation action plan including the reforms to expand the use of the local currency in the economy address high dollarisation in the banking sector and support domestic savings in the economy through capital markets development. MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN GEORGIAS natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia. Energy needs of the country are growing steadily on average by 3.6 for electricity and by 5.3 for natural gas. The needs are being addressed by constructing HPPs renovating and rehabilitating internal and external electricity grid and natural gas pipelines. Currently only an estimated 2025 of Georgias hydro potential is utilised. The pipeline of investment projects in the energy sector is estimated at about US 4.4 billion in the next five to seven years including US 2.5 billion for three large HPP projects Nenskra Khudoni and Tskhenistskali cascade. Currently 43 power plants 1.5GW are at various stages of construction or development with 102 more 3.7GW at feasibility study stage. Government policy over the last decade has encouraged investment in the hydropower sector resulting in 28 new HPPs with a total capacity of 509.9MW being added to the system over 20122017. Georgias transmission capacity is poised to increase and accommodate an additional installed capacity of 3.5GW by 2027 to meet the growth in export and domestic demand. Georgia is foreseen to be an electricity transit hub for neighbouring economies. In 20162017 already 1104GWh was transited through Georgia to neighbouring countries. Attractive place for foreign investors. Georgias businessfriendly environment coupled with its sustainable growth prospects continues to attract foreign investments. Georgias liberal economic reforms and businessfriendly environment supported substantial Foreign Direct Investment FDI over the past decade. These capital flows boosted productivity and accelerated growth. Public infrastructure projects were also instrumental in driving steps towards improving relations with Russia but as of the date of this Annual Report these have not resulted in any formal or legal changes in the relationship between the two countries. Relations between Russia and Turkey remain uncertain as despite Russia repealing sanctions on Turkey in March 2017 certain sanctions and legal limitations on Turkish nationals remain. In April 2017 amendments to the Turkish constitution were approved by voters in a referendum. The amendments which grant the president wider powers are expected to transform Turkeys system of government away from a parliamentary system. These amendments could have a negative impact on political stability in Turkey which is already tense after a failed coup against the president in July 2016. Conflict remains unabated between Azerbaijan and Armenia. MITIGATION The Group actively monitors regional and local market conditions and risks related to political instability and performs stress and scenario tests in order to assess our financial position. Responsive strategies and action plans are also developed. Despite tensions in the breakaway territories Russia has continued to open its export market to Georgian exports since 2013. While lower global commodity prices and macroeconomic factors have affected Georgias regional trading partners leading to lower exports within the region Georgia has benefited from increased exports earnings from nontraditional markets such as Switzerland China Egypt Saudi Arabia South Korea and Singapore.

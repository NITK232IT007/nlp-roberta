 Pet numbers increased by 10 between 2012 and 2015 to 623 million in contrast to a decline in farm animal numbers by 9 to 296 million. Of the European medicines sector valued at approximately 6bn in 2017 sales of vaccines and parasiticides represent 30 each 1.8bn with antimicrobials falling to 13 market share. The market as a whole grew by 9 in that period. Animal health markets in both Europe and the US are now dominated by their respective companion animal sectors. The latter valued at approximately 5.9bn www.ahi.org. Our Primary Market The enlarged Group now generates 57 of its revenues from its sales in the Companion Animal and Equine sector and is therefore well placed to benefit from the rise in European pet ownership and spend. The Group still generates strong sales from the Production Animal sector in niche profitable product areas. The Group comprises direct sales and marketing operations in 7 European territories see graphic on page 4. Distribution to European and Rest of World geographic territories is managed by our export team. The pharmaceutical licensing is managed through our inhouse regulatory team or local consultants where necessary. Our revenue from export sales has increased steadily in recent years and offers great potential for future growth. The Group will continue to serve the Small and Large Animal markets and bring new products to each both play an important role in the area of antiparasitic treatment also grew well in 2017. We were pleased with the performance across our export network. Our key core export markets of France the Nordics and UK and Ireland showed significant growth and we expect to benefit from ongoing direct sales in the UK now following the acquisition. During the period we signed new distribution agreements to cover New Zealand and Taiwan and both regions granted regulatory approval to sell Aqupharm intravenous fluid range and Isocare anaesthesia our recently launched products for use in surgery. This contributed to the growth of Aqupharm and Isocare sales which were ahead of management expectations and sales of core established brands such as Danilon antiinflammatory Otoclean dermatology and Caniquantel antiparasitics all showed double digit growth. Dinalgen antiinflammatory sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets. The positive impact of the crossselling opportunity was minimal during the year. We expect to see this contribute to our organic growth during Q4 2018 later than originally anticipated with a more meaningful contribution in 2019. The underlying EBITDA performance of our Pharmaceuticals division increased by 15.1 to 9.7m 97.1 of the Groups underlying EBITDA with reported EBITDA reducing to 7.5m 2016 10.2m. Whilst this underlying growth was driven by the contribution of the acquisition the organic performance in this division was impacted by lower gross margins mainly due to a changing sales mix following higher growth from lower for all of Iains work on the integration of Animalcare and Ecuphar and we wish him well for the future. Iains role as COO will not be replaced and has been redistributed within the senior management team that he was accountable for who will take on further responsibilities and report directly to myself. The key component to ensuring we continue to deliver on our longterm growth strategy is to continue to attract and retain the highest calibre people to drive forward our development. I would like to extend my thanks to all of our staff for their hard work. Brexit The details of how the UK pharmaceutical regulations will be extracted from the current harmonised European structure are not yet clear. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate UK Government agency is looking for close cooperation to enable a smooth transition to ensure animal welfare and food safety. The recent acquisition has enabled the new Group to start restructuring its pharmaceutical licence ownership with legal entities in the UK and Europe postBrexit to allow uninterrupted commercial supply of product. We will continue to monitor the situation and take the necessary action to ensure business continuity.

This growth was primarily driven by very strong growth in Production Animals revenue which as an overall category increased by 25.2 versus prior year to 28.4m together with a strong contribution from the Companion Animals category. Further detail on revenue by product category is given below. Underlying EBITDA improved by 15.1 to 9.7m however declined by 3.6 from continuing business to 8.1m 2016 8.4m representing an EBITDA margin of 15.6 2016 18.1. This decline was driven by a combination of lower gross margins which fell by 2.3 to 53.6 and a 2.3m increase in operating costs.

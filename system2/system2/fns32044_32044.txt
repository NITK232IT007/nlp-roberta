indd 1 09082017 160340 25546.04 9 August 2017 358 PM Proof Six Introduction My first statement to shareholders as Executive Chairman reflects on two strong but contradictory themes. Firstly the past year has been very challenging both operationally and financially. Business performance has fallen short of expectations we have outgrown some of our business processes and controls and we have experienced significant changes to our Board. Equally and more importantly it is already clear that the years ahead present significant upside opportunities. Strong value creation will result if we effectively implement our new strategy and successfully manage NCC Group through the transitional period in which we now find ourselves. Our business is not broken indeed it has some notable strengths both financial and operational. We still enjoy significant organic growth in our core markets and have a strong balance sheet. Furthermore in a constantly evolving and complex market our unique market leading skills and capabilities are keeping us at the forefront of thought leadership. This is recognised by customers who reward us with high levels of repeat business. If we improve our organisation and how we go to market we will also see material value creation. Business performance The financial performance is an attractive business and provides a stabilising influence on the Group. This is a nonGAAP or Alternative Performance Measure APM. Adjusted figures exclude the amortisation of acquired intangibles individually significant items sharebased charges the unwinding of discount on deferred and contingent consideration the results of the exited Domain Services business and any associated tax thereon. NCC Group has a unique opportunity we hold leading positions in growing markets around the world our customers value us and our workforce is exceptionally skilled. However we need to change how we organise ourselves and improve our internal business processes. Only by doing this will we be able to capture the significant value available to us Executive Chairmans statement BUSINESS OVERVIEW 2 www.nccgroup.trust Stock Code NCC NCC AR2017 proof 8Front.indd 2 09082017 160344 25546.04 9 August 2017 358 PM Proof Six Finally the Review identified two of the smaller Assurance businesses that sit outside the cyber golden thread whose future would be better served under alternative ownership. These businesses Web Performance and Software Testing will be disposed of in due course. Subsequently we initiated the development of a new threephase Strategic Plan and revised Target Operating Model in order to underpin our go to market and delivery strategies. In the next 12 to 24 months we intend to focus more of our efforts on internal selfhelp measures than has been the case historically. This should ensure that we reverse the margin compression seen in both trading divisions and across most territories in the added after sales services. Not all of the Groups sales of products are third party products. Particularly through the Fox business we offer some very highend products to customers that combine hardware and software in one package. This includes DetACT for use by transactional financial services companies and Data Diodes a product range that helps secure oneway data communications such as a utility meter. Both products are sufficiently differentiated that they can attract better margins than third party product reselling. As one of the worlds largest service led security consultancies the Group is capable of leading all cyber security bids rather than having to look for support from larger third parties. Software testing and website performance Essential websites software and infrastructure that support an organisation do not just need protection from malicious attacks they also need guaranteed performance levels. Flaws in code can prevent software from operating at optimum levels and spikes in online traffic can throw websites offline. Currently NCC Group undertakes more than three million web page tests per day for clients worldwide. Average monthly no. of Associates globally 2016 176 Employees globally 2016 1323 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 8 www.nccgroup.trust Stock Code NCC NCC AR2017 proof 8Front.indd 8 09082017 160355 25546.04 9 August 2017 358 PM Proof Six CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITIONS PSC PSC was acquired in September 2016 as part of the Groups strategy of acquiring relatively small bolton consulting businesses.

 We aim to double the earnings of new investments under our ownership through operational improvements international growth and careful MA strategies. This year 93 of our portfolio companies by value grew their earnings 2016 84. Action was the strongest performer again it is a very special company and a low price consumer champion. As a fast growth disruptive retailer Action has been transformed by the successful execution of its international expansion strategy. Store openings increased from 52 in 2012 to 197 in 2016 and Action now has more than 890 stores and annual sales in excess of 2.6 billion. The compound annual growth rates for sales and EBITDA since 2012 exceed 30 like for like growth rates are 67 per annum and cash ow is strong. This sectorleading performance under our ownership has already resulted in cash distributions to 3i equivalent to 4.9x our original investment. There is still plenty of runway for expansion at Action and potential for further rapid value growth for 3i. Action has been welcomed in each country it has opened in and its store opening programme now covers six countries and more new stores are planned in 2017 over 2016. Action is also set to open its fourth and fth distribution centres in 2017. Such material growth requires strong operational capability and Action with support from 3i is focused on by more than 100. The outlook looks promising with further expansion in China and North America in progress. Aspen Pumps Audley Travel BasicFit Q Holding and EuroDiesel also performed well with strong organic earnings growth. However it is inevitable that there will be some challenges in any broadbased Private Equity portfolio and our high street retailer Christ suffered from declining footfall. As mentioned earlier we have refocused our model and have largely exited the older and often minority investments that we invested in before the strategic review in 2012. Many of these assets have required a great deal of asset management. Some but not all have been a signicant drag on the value growth of our portfolio over the last few years. In August 2016 we became aware of accounting irregularities at Agent Provocateur which had concealed its true nancial position and lack of liquidity. We wrote down the investment to nil and the business was subsequently sold through an administration process with the proceeds being insufcient to return any value to 3i resulting in a total write down in the year of 49 million. In total our Private Equity realisation activity produced approximately 1 billion of cash proceeds this year 2016 718 million at good return multiples and we now own a leaner higherperforming portfolio of 37 assets and three quoted stakes 2016 47 assets and ve quoted stakes. Our permanent capital is a distinct competitive advantage. It ensures we can be exible and opportunistic and it is a fundamental aspect of our differentiated strategy. It enables us to hold assets for longer periods if we believe that there is potential for additional value creation. This is particularly important in an economic environment where there are limited opportunities for attractive new investment at sensible prices. We are well established in continental Europe and were the rst private equity rm to set up a number of ofces across Europe. Our brand and local investment teams are held in high regard in these markets and we enjoy good visibility over the deal ow in our chosen sectors. As the requirements of managing the older assets have diminished we have been able to source and complete more new investment opportunities. We completed new investments in BoConcept Schlemmer and Ponroy Sant together with a further investment in Q Holding to support its acquisition of Degania in FY2017. A German investment Lampenwelt and a Dutch investment Hans Anders were announced in March 2017 and April 2017 respectively and should complete by the end of June 2017. We also announced an investment in Formel D in May 2017. A year of exceptional investment activity in Infrastructure Our Infrastructure business has achieved good growth since 3iNs change of strategy and update to its return target announced in May 2015. Although the infrastructure market is very competitive particularly for larger economic infrastructure assets 3iNs revised investment strategy enabled the business to compete with condence for assets that tted its current midmarket remit.

As previously reported we sold our remaining surplus freehold property for 1.2 million in December 2016. The propertys carrying value had previously been adjusted to reflect the expected net sale proceeds which after disposal costs amounted to 1.17 million. The process that we started some years ago to dispose of six freehold properties which had become surplus to operating requirements has generated more than 7 million of cash which has supported distributions to shareholders in excess of 11 million over the same period. At the year end our cash balances were 6.4 million compared with 5.4 million last year. The increase reflects the proceeds from the sale of property referred to above. Operating cash flows were 580000 2016 818000 and dividends paid amounted to 635000 2016 631000. Net assets at 30 September 2017 were 6.4 million compared to 3.2 million at 30 September 2016. This significant increase is principally due to the elimination of the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme under IAS 19. Net of deferred tax the position on the scheme has improved by 3.4 million during the year due largely to improved surrender terms for the schemes principal asset. This matter is explained further in the Chief Executives Statement. The Directors are proposing to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share 2016 3.0p giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p to 1.17 million after costs. Following the sale we have achieved expected cash cost savings of around 20000 a year. Outlook Balancing the migration of customers from our legacy ERP products to Quantum VS whilst identifying and converting new business opportunities for Quantum VS and Vecta remains our principal focus. Wider economic factors and uncertainty over Brexit in particular continue to affect business confidence generally and may impact discretionary capital expenditure decisions including replacement of IT systems. However the strength of our business model built around an 80 recurring revenue base together with continued investment in our sales team and product development should mean we are well placed to deal with the challenges we face over the coming year. Finally I would like to thank all of my colleagues throughout the business for their hard work and commitment during the year. Julian Wassell Chief Executive 12 December 2017 Vecta is an extremely powerful combined CRM and BI product which drives sales growth for businesses in a range of verticals.

The respiratory sector is one of the most highly regulated resulting in high barriers to entry. A number of key drugs are shortly coming off patent resulting in a number of new generic entrants and associated opportunities for Bespak to supply both metered dose inhaler MDI and dry powder inhaler DPI devices. Although sales remain relatively flat in the traditional Western economies significant volume growth is being seen in emerging markets with the Brazilian Russian Indian and Chinese BRIC markets becoming more important to Bespak. Strategy The Group intends to increase its share funding. Atlas is a diagnostic company developing ultra rapid point of care tests for a range of infectious diseases. Consort now holds a 15.2 shareholding in Atlas 13.4 on a fully diluted basis having invested a total to date of 9.4m in the company. This investment followed Atlas Genetics successful CE marking for the Chlamydia Trachomatis CT io test cartridge and the funding was raised to finance the continued development of the combined Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea CTNG assay and test cartridge. This is planned for regulatory approvals in the US and Europe around early 2018. The equity raise also provides funding to expand manufacturing capacity at Bespak which is Atlas development and manufacturing partner. 25378.04 19 July 2017 402 PM Proof 5 18 consortmedical.com Stock Code CSRT OUR PERFORMANCE Strategic Report CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Bespak has a wellestablished and diverse core business of products in volume manufacturing with a strong pipeline of innovative products. These products include respiratory nasal ocular and injectable drug delivery as well as point of care diagnostics. Once again the business has grown in the year supported by the commercialisation of two of its development pipeline projects. Revenue grew 3.3 to 121.1m with Bespaks leading respiratory products continuing to perform well and strong growth of the injectables business. The Groups diversification strategy to reduce its dependence on respiratory products has made good progress with nonrespiratory sales now at 21 of revenue compared to 8 in 2012. Bespak grew revenue despite the impact of a lower emphasis on Customer Focus in the coming year. Activities in this regard include customer service benchmarking workshops and local site improvements. In order to truly bring the values to life this year we will also develop and launch a competency framework. We reward and recognise the values Groupwide as demonstrated by the CEO awards made annually. This year the Bespak Award winner was Julie Gathercole who was celebrated not just for her achievements but also the manner of her approach and her embodiment of our values. A large team at Zwickau together with three employees at Monheim received the Aesica CEO award for their tremendous results driven work and all demonstrated strong teamwork to deliver outstanding results.

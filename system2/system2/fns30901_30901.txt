 Thirdly Serco employs over 50000 people including those at our joint venture operations the vast majority of whom are responsible for delivering on a daily basis critical and sensitive frontline services for Government. Our success therefore is dependent on how well we select manage organise motivate develop and engage the people who work for Serco. Every year we run a detailed Viewpoint employee survey to gauge how well our colleagues think we are doing and I am delighted to say that for the fourth successive year the aggregated measure of employee engagement improved again in 2017 with some 31000 people responding. You can read more about all of these points in the Chief Executives Review on pages 32 to 43. Achieving our financial targets Our initial guidance for 2017 Underlying Trading Profit was between 65m and 70m with the result of 69.8m therefore coming in at the top of that range. Supporting this we achieved our targeted cost savings through the delivery of operational efficiency improvements. Furthermore we have continued to reduce the burden of lossmaking contracts which is also paramount to ensuring sustainable profitability. Chairmans Statement 2017 has seen further progress in implementing the strategy presented to shareholders in 2015.

The security of supply of these contracts is a matter of national importance and a proper concern of Government. How did we get into this position The answer is nobody is blameless. Company managers and directors should have remembered the adage that no deal is better than a bad deal and that overoptimistic accounting judgements or flattering reported cash flow will always be found out in the end and that pension deficits were not a temporary aberration but a liability that needed to be addressed. And for its part Government has used its position as a monopoly buyer to push companies large and small into accepting contractual terms and risks that they could not conceivably manage or hedge. Sooner or later some of those risks were bound to crystallise and when they did suppliers delivering vital public services would be mortally wounded and even become functionally or formally insolvent which would not be in the interests of either taxpayers or service users. Where will the market go next Clearly both Government and suppliers should take time to consider carefully the implications of recent events. Suppliers will likely become much more wary there will be fewer new entrants existing players may shift the balance of their attention towards other markets if they can.

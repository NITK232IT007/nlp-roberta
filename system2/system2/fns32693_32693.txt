 In July 2017 the vemonth programme was launched in seven Blended Branches nationwide and 88 recent college graduates participated learning the skills needed to prepare them for an inside sales position. The goal of the programme is to increase the speed of impact for new hires. Various metrics will be used to measure the participants added value to the business including sales their potential and retention prospects. Whilst we are committed to recruiting and growing early career talent we also acquire talent with specic skills mid career to enhance our ability to bring new services to the market and improve our capabilities. Great examples of hiring people with capabilities developed outside our sector have enabled us to accelerate the growth of our business. For example our new National Sales Centre Director in the USA Josh Smith brings expertise from over 20 years in professional customer service centre management. Rewarding performance We celebrate success and our reward programmes are important in reinforcing the way we do business. Over the past year new incentive programmes have been redeveloped in each business for branch and sales associates to ensure that high performance is well rewarded. We adjust measures to the type of role or team but typically incentivise based on combinations of trading prot gross margin gross prot average cashto cash days and net promoter score. 7 000 current associates have higher education degrees about 28 requirements. Protecting information As our channels to market develop so too does the technology that we employ and the data that we hold. We are committed to protecting the security of our systems and information so that customers can transact with us safe in the knowledge that we have the appropriate safeguards in place. The Group operates an IT governance framework including a full set of dedicated IT policies aligned to known security and operational risks. A broader Group information security policy determines how we protect all information wherever it exists and in whatever form electronic or hardcopy.

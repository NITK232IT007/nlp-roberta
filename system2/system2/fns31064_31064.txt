Delay in Regulatory approval timeline Potential uses of the product expanded throughout the year with the move to a more inpatient focus addressing the surgical wound reconstruction and orthopaedic trauma application areas. In order to address these new clinical uses sales and marketing costs of 64K were incurred in the period 11 month period to December 2016 79K which are expected to yield revenue benefits in FY18. Business Review 2017 was another successful year for DermaPure as we continue to establish momentum and sales traction. The GPO agreements with Premier and Vizient have now been in place for a full year and allowed us to access a new quota of hospitals. During 2017 over 30 DermaPure evaluations were undertaken and over another 25 initiated due to complete during 2018. Our clinical affairs team continue to identify and monitor relevant case studies with 13 inpatient cases followed highlighting DermaPure s positive clinical outcome for replacing tissue and in providing structural support. Throughout the year the uses of DermaPure expanded into new clinical areas with particular focus on urological and gynaecological applications. This was in part led by the need for innovation in this area with the increasing scrutiny and reluctance to use mesh based products to treat cases of pelvic organ prolapse. DermaPure has proven to be an optimal treatment solution in these cases. Our sales teams continue to convert large integrated delivery networks IDN and larger hospital accounts with significant approvals from the Memorial Hermann and Cleveland Clinic Health System. Moving forward with the acceptance of the dCELL and BioRinse applications and working with our CellRight and BioSurgery colleagues increase awareness of the versatility of our augmented product portfolio in various orthopaedic procedures.

Business Review We initiated the integration with Tissue Regenix in August 2017 and looked at ways to quickly maximise our combined experience and facilities. The Tissue Regenix US officebased workforce moved into the CellRight facility to allow collaborative working and culture. The initial steps for the technology transfer of DermaPure commenced which will allow the Group to have an important second source supplier as demand increases and we began to review the processing needs for the production of OrthoPure HT. Important business infrastructures were implemented to ensure compliance and standardisation across all functions including finance human resources and marketing approval processes. Historically we have commercialised our products through a network of distributors and white label OEM agreements. This continued during 2017 as we signed our first distribution agreement for our Amnion product targeting applications in orthopaedics and ophthalmology.

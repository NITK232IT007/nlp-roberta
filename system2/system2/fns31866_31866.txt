There is an estimated requirement of up to 275000 homes per annum. Government policies may help to stabilise house price growth but it remains to be seen if they will increase supply significantly leaving an expected shortfall of more than sold to Housing Associations with Inland Homes subsequently securing construction contracts to build the planned residential units. The Group intends to increase this activity and expects this to be a growing revenue stream in the future.

Stephen Wicks Chief Executive INLAND HOMES ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 30 Stock code INL 25624.01 11 October 2017 425 PM Proof 2 The current annualised rental income from our commercial and residential investment activities as we continually seek to maximise the potential of our assets amounts to 2.6 million 2016 2.6 million and we will selectively sell some of these assets in order to reduce our net gearing. Our development sites are principally around the M25 and M11 corridor as well as on the South Coast around Poole in Dorset and Southampton in Hampshire. We believe these areas of the market both in terms of pricing and location will continue to remain relatively stable over the medium term largely underpinned by Village of up to 2000 new homes on 30 acres of land of which 18 acres are either owned or controlled by our joint venture company. The site sits immediately adjacent to Cheshunt Station 27 minutes to London Liverpool Street and the proposed new Crossrail 2 route. The setting is regarded by Broxbourne Borough Council as a key delivery location for much needed new homes and employment space in the Borough. Over the last year our land and planning team have assisted the Local Authority in increasing the development allocation from 1000 residential units to approximately 2000 units across the wider masterplan. The Group has a 50 interest in this development site and a planning application is expected to be submitted in December 2017 once we have successfully incorporated the requirements of key stakeholders and have a masterplan that can support the Borough through their Local Plan process. The resultant masterplan will include new community facilities a new two form entry primary school and employment space comprising uses such as offices healthcare business leisure restaurant and retail. 31 www.inlandhomes.co.uk STRATEGIC REPORT 25624.01 11 October 2017 425 PM Proof 2 Chief Executives Review Continued Chapel Riverside Southampton This regeneration site was secured by way of a Development Agreement with Southampton City Council whereby Inland Homes has obtained outline planning approval for 457 apartments plus 64000 sq ft of commercial space with a detailed approval for the first phase of 72 units which is now under construction. The gross development value of recruitment at both head office and site level and as expected this investment has brought about a planned increase in overheads with staff numbers having increased from 39 on 1 July 2016 to 74 at the year end. This facet of the business will deliver improved processes and structures that will accommodate an expansion in our production. Moreover by managing this construction activity ourselves we can deliver cost savings over the long term and enable greater control and certainty over the delivery and timing of projects. We currently have 427 units under construction including 43 included within a joint venture across 12 sites of which 316 units 74 are being delivered inhouse. In order to control our working capital requirements our policy has always been to forward sell our homes. This has been further bolstered by engaging in land disposals to potential landlords with forward funded construction contracts which will have a positive and growing impact on revenue profits and net borrowings. Outlook We are continuing to see strong demand for sites within our land portfolio especially from Housing Associations who have been tasked by the government to increase the number of homes within their portfolios. The Groups strategy is to use more of its land bank for its own housebuilding activities and procure planning permissions in order to deliver sites that could be either sold outright or with the benefit of a construction contract or be developed to extract the development contribution.

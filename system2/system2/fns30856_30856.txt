This was achieved against the backdrop of an external environment characterised by regulatory proposals and changes tax challenges and intense competition. We provide muchneeded access to regulated credit for people who might otherwise be financially excluded and while we continue to modernise the Group in response to the changing needs of consumers our values of being respectful responsible and straightforward guide the way we serve our customers and govern our business. Led by the Board we continued to take an active approach to risk management. This together with product innovation and our regulatory stakeholder engagement programme supports the work we have undertaken to help protect our business model. I was delighted to see our businesses receive numerous prestigious awards over the course of the year in recognition of our responsible lending practices outstanding corporate culture and offering a great place to work all of which are indicative of the high regard we are held in when serving customers managing risk and developing our people. Our strategy We understand our consumer segment well and are evolving the business to ensure our products and services suit customers changing needs and circumstances. By offering a broader choice of more competitively priced products including longerterm home credit and as a leading nonbanking financial institution in many of our markets we are a respected financial brand and awardwinning employer. Our values underpin our business model and we operate and make decisions consistent with being responsible respectful and straightforward. Credit risk is managed responsibly using robust credit scoring systems and credit bureaux and in our home credit businesses these systems are supported by the critical judgement of agents. We have a low and grow strategy starting new customers on smaller shorterterm loans and only offer more credit once their creditworthiness is proven. High standards of governance are essential to the sustainability of our business and we actively identify manage and aim to mitigate the principal risks we face. Our profit is generated from lending responsibly while managing the business efficiently. Our home credit businesses generate a high proportion of Group revenue primarily through the agentservice model. While IPF Digital delivers a smaller contribution currently we believe it offers a significant future growth opportunity driven by increased demand for online lending and the ability to operate within a regulatory environment where the trend is for lowercost products. People We resource the business with skilled motivated and knowledgeable employees and agents who implement our strategy and ensure our customers are well served. Technology Technology is fundamental to driving efficiency through agent mobile technology supporting digital lending growth and making effective credit decisions. Financial We manage financial resources effectively to sustain our business and generate good returns for our investors. Relationships Open quality of our products and service. We do not retain customers who have a poor payment history as it can create a continuing impairment risk and runs counter to our responsible lending commitments. Performance The proportion of employees and agents who have worked with us for more than 12 months. Employee retention improved slightly on 2016. Agent retention reduced as a result of changes to criteria required to offer financial services in the Czech Republic together with contraction in that business and new employment regulations in Romania. Why we measure it Experienced people help us achieve and sustain strong customer relationships and deliver a highquality service. Good retention also helps reduce recruitment and training costs enabling more investment in people development.

Market review 2017 On an average basis silver prices fell slightly to 17.09 in 2017 from 17.14 in 2016. This was in sharp contrast to 2016 when shortterm investors alongside longterm investors purchased the metal and drove prices sharply higher. Healthy global economic conditions kept silver prices from rising further although factors such as US tension with North Korea the Syrian conflict and the Catalonia referendum provided a degree of support. In addition continued equity market strength also played a part in price suppression throughout 2017. US tax reform helped the stock market repeatedly hit record highs in December further driving investors away from precious metals. While the Federal Reserve delivered three rate hikes in 2017 inflation did not become a concern which was another factor that stood in silvers way. Demand Investors were net buyers of 108.1 million ounces silver in 2017. The net additions to investor holdings were lower than the average added to inventories annually between 2009 and 2016 but still remained high by historical standards. The net buying and production was achieved in June 2015 with the mine being ramped up to full production within three months. The operation was also designed and built in a modular fashion to facilitate cost effective expansion potential.

Results in the area to the south west of the Angela vein have so far confirmed the presence of nine new veins close to the existing mine infrastructure. The first results from almost 5000 metres of drilling are detailed below and show in particular the potential of the Millet vein. The current campaign will continue throughout 2018 and will include further potential drilling as well as infill drilling and resource conversion. The Company expects to provide further updates on drill results throughout the year. In addition mine development during the third quarter allowed a reinterpretation of the geological model at the deposit and identified a further 9.7 million silver equivalent ounces of resources.

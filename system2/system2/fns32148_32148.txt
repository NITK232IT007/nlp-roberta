Impairment charges to goodwill have been recognised in prior periods. With the continued difficult macroeconomic environment in Europe and the changing regulatory environment globally the risk that goodwill is impaired increases. For the CGUs which contain goodwill the determination of recoverable amount being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use requires judgement on the part of management in both identifying and then valuing the relevant CGUs. Recoverable amounts are based on managements view of variables such as future average revenue per user average customer numbers and customer churn timing and approval of future capital spectrum and operating expenditure and the most appropriate discount rate. In the year ended 31 March 2017 a pretax impairment charge of 4.5 billion was recognised related to goodwill in India. Refer to area of focus on Significant oneoff transactions. Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report note 1 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty note 4 Impairment losses and note 10 Intangible assets. We evaluated the appropriateness of managements identification of the Groups CGUs and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the impairment assessment process including indicators of impairment.

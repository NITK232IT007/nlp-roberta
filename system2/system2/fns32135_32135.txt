 The lists now have unfussy descriptions of the flavours and the move has resulted in customers trading up to more premium wines. Our efforts have also been noticed outside of Fullers and we have just taken the title of Pub Merchant of the Year at the Sommelier Wine Awards. Craft beers also continued to perform well across the Managed estate with sales increasing of both Fullers own range and those from other brewers. In addition our Managed Pubs now have access to an even wider range of brands through Nectar. All of these trends have helped invested like for like drinks sales to grow 3.1. With customers looking for new exciting and experiential reasons to visit the pub we look to provide many and varied interesting events. The popular Shakespeare in the Garden programme featured Twelfth Night last summer and once again we had a full house at each performance. We will be rerunning the My Dads Pub competition that we created last year whereby one lucky father wins his own pub for the day including personalisation of the pubs hanging sign. Our Fullers Kitchen campaign continues seizing the opportunities presented by Instagram to share photos of delicious dishes through social media to whet our customers appetites. Fullers Kitchen has also been focusing on monthly offers that combine food and drink and over 12000 of these were redeemed over a five month period order whether any diner has allergy requirements. Focused on fresh ingredients Fresh produce is vitally important to our business and we work in genuine partnership with our suppliers to get great meat fish and fresh fruit and vegetables. Take Sheringhams for instance working with British farmers to get the best seasonal produce at its peak. Thats why if you have broad beans in a Fullers pub in June they will have travelled less than 100 miles and you can really taste the freshness. Truly British truly local truly summer. 120 metres of Beef Wellington sold on Christmas Day alone. 33 Strategic Report Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fuller Smith Turner P.L.C. Corporate Social Responsibility continued Issues around obesity continue to dominate the headlines and we took the decision during the year to change the Pepsi on our soda guns in our Managed estate to sugarfree Pepsi Max. This reflects changing consumer trends in our own venues and UK sales in general. We have used a sugar free lemonade on our soda gun for many years so the move to a sugarfree cola was a natural progression. We have also continued work to reduce the sugar and salt content of our menus through a number of initiatives. We have introduced new training to upskill our chefs understanding of healthy food and this has led to less salt being put into our dishes. We always have salt and pepper on the table so customers can still add their own but the choice explained in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 44 to 50. No change.

 Part of building strong communities is the care we put into designing them from the outset. By creating great places that leave a legacy for future generations we enhance communities for years to come. This can be seen in the success we have had with the industry design standard Building for Life 12. These principles are designed to give the home buyer confidence that important design elements have been checked during the planning process. Currently we have won 56 Built for Life accreditations which is more than every other housebuilder combined. Schools are the future of a community which is why we work closely with them on a range of initiatives. We recently launched a new health and safety programme for schools designed to highlight the hazards of construction sites with tailored resources for both teachers and pupils. We also support communities through charitable donations and fundraising for local initiatives. Around the country our 27 divisions commercial developments business and Group support functions have worked hard raising money for chosen charities from traditional sports dinners and blind auctions to golf days sponsored walks and even an afternoon tea on the Queens birthday. The Barratt Charity Plan allows any fundraising for a chosen charity to be matched by up to 10000. Barratt has also made several donations in response to emergencies and take advantage of appropriate land buying and operational opportunities to help deliver sustainable shareholder value.

 Prudential regulation is moving from the current regulatory basis to Solvency Assessment and Management SAM. This was delayed from 1 July 2017 to 1 July 2018 SAM is recognised as equivalent to the Solvency II regime. Additionally the governmentled reform to retirement legislation was introduced in August 2017. This makes trustees of retirement funds responsible for providing default solutions at retirement with retirement benefit counselling provided by each pension scheme to provide information on default options at retirement. US care market The US represents an opportunity for our Group in this significant market. Within the care segment the US has a similar backdrop to the UK with a governmentfunded safety net but significant volumes of selffunders. Total annual spending is estimated at 145bn of which 45bn is selffunded. There is widespread acceptance of the need to selffund with many wishing to avoid State dependency. There are very limited underwritten guaranteed income for life options available to consumers in the US market. The target market for our Groups products are US residents in later life receiving or about to receive longterm domiciliary or residential care and able to afford a single premium. 10 Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 Operating Model We operate a business model with mutually reinforcing strengths which delivers superior outcomes Key strengths Our People The combination of Just Retirement and Partnership created an opportunity which we seized to create a best of both worlds staffing model backed by a renewal of our Ltd and Partner Reinsurance Company Ltd.

Warning about unsolicited approaches to shareholders and Boiler Room scams In recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in UK investments. These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms. These brokers can be very persistent and persuasive. Just Group plc shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of such approaches and advised to only deal with firms authorised by the FCA. You can check whether an enquirer is properly authorised and report scam approaches by contacting the FCA on www.fca.org.ukconsumers or by calling the FCA Consumer Helpline 0800 111 6768.

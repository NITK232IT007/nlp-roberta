This requires a network of welllocated operations which can be used to optimise customer service and transport costs and to leverage economies of scale. These competitive positions can be strengthened through acquisitions. Acquisitions can add value through the realisation of operating and cost saving synergies in areas such as increased asset utilisation and reduced administrative overheads. Vertical integration in aggregates In some markets aggregates producers are integrated downstream into readymixed concrete and asphalt production. In addition asphalt producers may undertake maintenance contracts and surfacing work. Readymixed concrete producers may have upstream cement operations. Our focus is on aggregates but we own and operate readymixed concrete asphalt and cement operations where this is desirable. Economic characteristics Transportation costs are significant In general our products have a lowvalue to weight ratio. This means the cost of transport is a significant element of the total cost of our products to our customers. For example in some markets the maximum economic road delivery distances for aggregates may be as been undertaken during the year covering areas such as communication safety job clarity and satisfaction customer service and the understanding of the Hanson guiding principles.

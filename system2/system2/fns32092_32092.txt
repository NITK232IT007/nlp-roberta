Be it business marriage or friendship in a relationship lasting this many years both parties evolve and constantly adapt. Sometimes you choose to compromise and at other times you stand your ground. The important thing is that both parties have a common understanding of each others objectives and communication is fluid. In our time working with Matthew Clark our company has grown from less than 100 pubs to over 900. At each stage of our development we have received a reliable and appropriate service in terms of product range distribution and management support. Whether it be through the complete supply chain management of our house wine Coldwater Creek to the supply and distribution of the UKs most popular vodka brand Smirnoff the end result for our Managers is the same. The lorry turns up when it should the driver puts the delivery away and there are very few errors. Reducing the increasingly complex task of sourcing and delivering wines and spirits for Wetherspoons to such simplicity has been in my view a real accomplishment. Which is why 25 or so years into our relationship despite the obvious quarrels and squabbles that one would naturally expect over so many years we are still together. John Hutson Chief Executive Officer JD Wetherspoons Private Landlord Dark Star Brewery Operations Winning Wine PubBar of the year last year at the Great British Pub awards was down to the great working partnership I have with Bibendum. Wine value has a work with the sales team in generating sales either by utilising our strategic partnerships or by simply helping knock on doors In retail we try to segment and tailor our product proposition to meet the demographics of the specific channel we are on shelf in. No retailer wants dust on a wine bottle so its all about relevance to target market. Fortunately these philosophies found deep favour in the enlarged Conviviality business and as such the last 12 months have allowed us very good growth. Clearly an organisation with scale provides opportunities if you can clearly align to the destination they are trying to get to. Conviviality works well for us in this respect as we believe our portfolio that Conviviality represent should help them influence every drinking occasion. Currently Conviviality are set apart from others by a combination of factors namely scale channel clarity and a collaborative approach. If you align to this the ability to use insight to create a joint forensic approach to new business acquisition then it is hard to see why success will not come. With scale comes data with data comes complexity. However as I see it currently Conviviality are asking the data the right questions to help us all find the right answers. Success looks different in different peoples eyes. From the perspective of Hatch Mansfield success is continued growth in relevant distribution with a rate of sale that makes the distribution work for the on and off trade retailers.

 We wish to increase the diversity of our portfolio such that it includes a wider range of commodities and assets thereby reducing the percentage of our income coming from coal and Kestrel in particular. We have also announced a desire to build a meaningful presence in commodities which are focused on the growing electric vehicle market where we see great potential. Our investment in 2017 in the Piau nickel project is an example of this focus combined with our strategy of looking to add preproduction royalties which will offer high return potential over the years. Our principal objective however remains the acquisition of producing or near production royalty and streaming assets. The team continues to be very disciplined in ensuring that acquisitions are of the highest quality in terms of project characteristics both technically and commercially and that we design transaction structures to optimise risk management. CORPORATE CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE Anglo Pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in all areas of its business. I believe this starts at the top. We broadened the agenda at our annual strategy day in 2017 to include sessions on strategy including corporate social responsibility risk and board effectiveness. These sessions were primarily facilitated by industry experts who brought an objective and impartial insight as to how the Board approaches these areas in executing its strategy. Whilst we acknowledge that we are not directly responsible for the operation of many of longerterm access to materials supply. Whilst some investors remain wary on battery materials given price volatility lithium assets in lower political risk regions such as South America and Australia should see growing interest whilst cobalt assets outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo are likely to be of interest given the challenges posed in that country. The DRCs heightened risk profile is driven in part by the recently revised mining code which includes increases in mining royalties the government free carry and also an excessprofits tax in addition to the redesignation of cobalt as a strategic metal. The mining market outlook for 2018 remains broadly positive as commentators expect underlying commodity prices to remain strong balance sheets to continue improving and equity valuations to tend towards midcycle multiples. A major driver for 2018 will be continued supplyside constraints driven in part by Chinese environmental reform initiatives which should continue to negatively impact supply. The political backdrop in key producing and trading countries will also increasingly impact sentiment towards the sector especially as a potential trade war emerges between the US and China. Overall volatility in 2018 should help surface attractive growth opportunities for Anglo Pacific. 1.

More importantly unlike conventional debt arrangements where interest payments tend to start immediately or are capitalised until cash payments can be made from a projects cash flow most royalties are payable only once the project comes into production and is generating sales. In addition many forms of debt such as project finance include restrictive covenants and may require commodity price hedges to be put in place. These are not only typically costly in terms of fees but can also limit the miners exposure to upside in the prices of their core commodities. SECONDARY ROYALTIES Source of liquidity for holders of existing royalties The value of a royalty is realised over the duration of the mine life. Often royalty owners may have a need to free up cash in order to recycle capital. There is a limited secondary market for royalties and Anglo Pacific can be a source of valuable liquidity for private royalty holders.

As such this asset is carried at cost less amortisation and impairments and does not benefit from any valuation uplift resulting from the positive developments in the year as described above. Its carrying value does however reflect the impact of translation from Australian dollars to pounds which at the yearend resulted in a favourable uplift. Royalty intangible assets are amortised when commercial production commences on a straightline basis over the expected life of the mine.

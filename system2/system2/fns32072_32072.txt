A year on this remains the case. The team has worked extremely hard over the last two years on the integration which has completed one year ahead of schedule. This means we can now give all our focus to pursuing opportunities to grow and take share prioritising longterm value creation while delivering continued strong cash generation and maintaining a robust balance sheet. Ours is a strategically strong and well managed business which is positioned to address the tougher trading environment forecast for the next few years. Overview We achieved another year of record results and market outperformance driven by a good performance from the underlying business and an additional sevenweek contribution from Spirit. Group revenue grew 6.9 ahead We are excited about the opportunities we see in our core pub retailing brands where the results from our brand conversions are showing very positive sales uplifts. We will continue with the programme over the coming years ensuring our pubs remain attractive and relevant to our customers as they face into the challenges that the economic uncertainties will undoubtedly bring. Within the pub sector Greene Kings combination of brands teams and assets leaves us well placed to deliver longterm growth and returns to shareholders. Uncertainty affecting both business and consumer confidence is likely to continue following the recent election and the unknown length and outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Alongside the rest of the industry we are experiencing significant cost pressures but Greene Kings scale and the consequent cost efficiencies not least from the Spirit integration should enable us to mitigate much of the cost increases. Our aim is to ensure that Greene King emerges from the nearterm period of uncertainty stronger than ever and I look forward to reporting on our progress towards this goal in a years time.

Annual report 2017 GREENE KING PLC 13 STRATEGIC REPORT Trading environment Consumer confidence in the UK has softened over the last 12 months with nominal wage growth starting to fall behind rising levels of cost inflation leading to a squeeze on disposable household income. While spending on essentials has held up discretionary spending has started to fall. Within this we believe that affordable treats such as visits to the pub will continue to play an important role in consumer discretionary spending. We anticipate that this challenging environment will intensify over the next few years partly due to the ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the UK. If this is the case we think our business model is well placed to outperform the market Pub Company has good national coverage with a bias towards London and the South East we operate pubs in the value mainstream and premium sectors and we have a good mix of sales between drink food and rooms. In addition 30 of our profits come from our cashgenerative nonretail businesses Pub Partners and Brewing Brands.

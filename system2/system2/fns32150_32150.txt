Kris Hagerman Chief Executive Officer 16 May 2017 AN EARLY COMMITMENT TO THE CLOUD HAS GIVEN SOPHOS A REAL AND GROWING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT CONTINUED 18 QA WITH MEMBERS OF THE SOPHOS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM MICHAEL VALENTINE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WORLDWIDE SALES Q. When you talk to customers what are their most pressing issues A. It really is the need to reduce complexity. These companies often have limited IT staff and rarely a security expert. They struggle to manage multiple security products and are even more challenged to respond to the daily alerts and notifications they receive. They want simplicity and flexibility. They want a seamless experience between reseller and vendor. They do not have the expertise to run lengthy IT procurement projects and rely on their IT resellers to our lives or be used against us for nefarious purposes. Security allows us to have the full benefits that computers can provide whilst keeping the evil aspects at bay. Q. What is the best way to stay ahead of security concerns and threats A. Be a smart consumer of the benefit of the ITization of our lives. Understand the basics of staying secure strong passwords prodigious patching etc. Consider the downsides as well as the advantages that can be provided and make a balanced decision. Stay careful and cautious online and when interacting with email and websites. If it sounds too good to be true treat with extreme caution.

We are a much leaner more focused organisation that makes predominantly branded and high valueadded products. This allows management and the business to focus on those areas that will drive longterm value creation to report near misses is key to achieving sustainable longterm change in safety behaviour. Against our target of 1001 ratio of near miss and behavioural conversations versus all types of accident by 2018 we achieved a ratio of 4231 an improvement on last years 1751 performance. Another important way of engaging our teams in safety is through our cultural change programme encouraging employees to Stop Think Assess Review STAR and complete STAR cards where they see safety related conditions or actions. By discussing and addressing these issues we have created greater levels of dialogue involvement and a safety first culture. To build on this programme in 2016 we introduced the STAR safe system of work SSoW conversations where front line managers initiate a conversation with a work colleague based on the recognised safe system of working. Through this discussion better and safer ways of working have been identified reducing our risks and injuries.

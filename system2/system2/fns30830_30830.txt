Gresham Technologies plc Annual granting fixedterm licence grants typically three to five years rather than perpetual licences for customers for whom subscription licensing is not appropriate. This has opened up charging for additional future periods of use for these customers beyond the fixed licence term of the contract with the first of these additional chargeable periods beginning in 2020. To date we have achieved initial licence fees under term agreements totalling 4.0m that we anticipate will repeat from 2020 onwards either as repeat upfront fees or additional annuity revenues of an equivalent 0.9m per annum this is in addition to our stated annualised recurring revenue as at 31 December 2017 which incorporates annually recurring revenues only. Clareti services revenues were up by 4 and 0.1m to 2.9m continuing the high levels of realisation and utilisation seen in the prior year as our services resources provided new and existing customers with consulting services to enable and increase Clareti use within their organisations. Other Solutions The Groups Other Solutions grew by 0.9m 9 to 10.6m in FY2017 although within this software revenues saw a decline and services a sharp increase as the shape of the portfolio changed markedly year on year. NonClareti software revenues from partners are down 0.9m 23 to 3.1m as one of our legacy partner relationships exited as planned in FY2017. This arrangement had a net contribution of 50.

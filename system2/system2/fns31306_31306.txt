During 2017 the Group has made very promising progress in the development of its MEXGOL SV and VAS gas and condensate fields in northeastern Ukraine with significant improvements in production rates leading to a much improved financial performance. At the Groups MEXGOL and SV fields production was reasonably stable during the first half of 2017 but in June 2017 the new MEX109 well utilising improved drilling and completion techniques developed as a result of recent studies was completed successfully and put on production and in August 2017 following completion of of all available geological geophysical petroleum engineering and well performance data. The continuing work included detailed reprocessing of existing 3D seismic data using the latest processing technology to try to improve the definition in such data. Interpretation of this new dataset is under way with the intention of utilising it to refine the new geological subsurface model of the fields. This work undertaken in conjunction with P .D.F. Limited will enable the Group to refine its strategies for the further development of the fields including the timing and level of future capital investment required to exploit the hydrocarbon resources. www.regalpetroleum.com 03 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 3 08052018 163804 26054.02 8 May 2018 257 PM Proof 5 The MEX109 well which was spudded in July 2016 targeted the Visean reservoirs BSands in the MEXGOL field. The well was drilled to a depth of 4873 metres and completed in the B20 Visean reservoir. It was brought on production in June 2017. The initial production rates were very encouraging and the well has been producing consistently in excess of 90000 m 3 d since then. In early 2017 the Group entered into an agreement with NJSC Ukrnafta the majority Stateowned oil and gas producer in relation to the SV2 well which is a suspended well owned by NJSC Ukrnafta located within the Groups SV licence area. Under the agreement the Group agreed to undertake a workover of the well which if successful would result in the well being brought back to monitor the situation and endeavours to procure its equipment from sources in other markets. The disputes and interruption to the supply of gas from Russia have indirectly encouraged Ukrainian Government support for the development of the domestic production of hydrocarbons since Ukraine imports a significant proportion of its gas which has resulted in legislative measures to improve the regulatory requirements for hydrocarbon extraction in Ukraine. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES www.regalpetroleum.com 11 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 11 08052018 163806 26054.02 8 May 2018 257 PM Proof 5 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES continued RISK MITIGATION Banking system in Ukraine The banking system in Ukraine has been under great strain in recent years due to the weak level of capital low asset quality caused by the economic situation currency depreciation changing regulations and other economic pressures generally and so the risks associated with the banks in Ukraine have been significant including in relation to the banks with which the Group has operated bank accounts. However following remedial action imposed by the National Bank of Ukraine Ukraines banking system has improved and at the end of May 2017 Moodys revised its outlook for the Ukrainian banking system from negative to stable. Nevertheless Ukraine continues to be supported by funding from the International Monetary Fund under a fouryear Extended Funding Facility aggregating 17.5 billion approved in March 2015. Since then Ukraine has received four tranches under the funding programme totalling 8.4 billion with the most recent tranche of 1 billion in the market and business environment in Ukraine and endeavours to recognise approaching risks and factors that may affect its business. In addition the involvement of Energees Management Limited as a major shareholder with extensive experience in Ukraine is considered helpful to mitigate such risks. Operational and technical risks Health Safety Environment and Security HSES The oil and gas industry by its nature conducts activities which can cause health safety environmental and security incidents. Serious incidents can not only have a financial impact but can also damage the Groups reputation and the opportunity to undertake further projects. The Group maintains an HSES management system and requires that management staff and contractors adhere to this system. The system ensures that the Group meets Ukraine legislative standards in full and achieves international standards to the maximum extent possible.

For example the Groups ability to pursue and develop its projects and development programmes depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital seasonal conditions regulatory approvals gas oil condensate and LPG prices development costs and drilling success.

While our focus in 2017 has been on the display market Nanocos technology has several important applications beyond that sector. Important progress was made during 2017 in two of the Groups three other target markets life sciences and specialised lighting. Of particular note the life sciences business was awarded an Innovate UK grant. In addition after the year end a commercial supply and license agreement was won from a US medical device company for light therapy products for the treatment of pain soft tissue injury and dermatological conditions such as acne and skin antiageing.

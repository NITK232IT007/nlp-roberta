 The land is typically sourced via public procurement or direct negotiation and is developed in partnership with local authorities housing associations or PRS providers. It is a lowcapital model offering strong returns and the flexibility of longterm development agreements many with phased viability and priority returns. The division has an excellent track record of winning new work reflecting over 30 years experience on over 60 regeneration schemes strong relationships with local authorities and expertise in placemaking. T ypically we secure around 40 per cent of bids we submit and with a current pipeline of approximately nine years we have excellent visibility of future work. Supply of both private and public land remains good. In particular during the period we saw a further increase in public sector land being released for regeneration giving us additional opportunities to secure more work. Labour supply continues to be constrained across the industry and we along with the Home Builders Federation have been encouraging the Government to protect the status of EU construction workers as a vital part of the UK economy and to protect future development. T o mitigate this risk we are recruiting a record number of apprentices and management trainees and have expanded our graduate recruitment programme. In addition our larger site profile allows us to retain and expand our supply chain by offering greater visibility of future work and longer contracts. Overall build cost inflation was approximately four per cent for the year up a significant proportion of the workforce especially in Greater London. Brexit negotiations have led to uncertainty over the security of the EU workforce not just from potential future employment restrictions but also from possible economic migration caused by Sterling devaluation. Our response We together with the Home Builders Federation have been encouraging the Government to protect the status of EU construction workers as a vital part of the UK economy. At the same time we are mitigating the risk of a lack of labour availability by recruiting a record number of apprentices and management trainees and expanding our graduate recruitment programme. Our directly employed workforce has grown from fewer than 600 in 2014 to over 1200 in 2017 as we focus on our growth agenda by recruiting retaining and developing the best talent at all levels. Our larger sites also allow us to retain and expand our supply chain by offering longerterm contracts and better quality working conditions. Offsite construction In order to meet the increased demand for housing despite the labour shortage the industry must look at different build methodologies to deliver growth in output. While the industry has not yet fully embraced nontraditional build several methods of offsite construction are being developed from timber frame construction to complete modular build. With Government and public sector land owner support together with potential future fire safety regulations the case for offsite construction has grown. The principal benefits are speed of build lower reliance on scarce site skills and improved reduction in vesting or recovery of amounts paid in certain circumstances. The Committee retains the flexibility to incorporate a twoyear postvest holding period as part of the LTIP in which Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell vested shares. This would take the total period from grant to release of LTIP shares to five years. The maximum LTIP award level is 200 per cent of base salary. Participants may at the Committees discretion receive dividends or dividend equivalents representing the value of dividends paid during the performance period on LTIP awards. LTIP performance will be assessed against a mix of metrics that will include a balance between financial and shareholder metrics. For the awards to be granted in the 2018 financial year these are relative TSR measured against a broadbased comparator group TNAV and ROCE. Targets are set on a sliding scale with no more than 25 per cent of each element vesting at threshold performance. The Committee will review and set weightings for measures and appropriate targets before each grant. The Committee may change the balance of the measures or use different measures for subsequent awards as appropriate. Pension Aids retention and to provide competitive levels of retirement benefit. Pension contributions are made into the Groups defined contribution scheme. Alternatively a participant may receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension typically in the scenario where they have reached the lifetime allowance for pension tax relief set by HMRC. The cash allowance is paid net of employers National registered with the Environmental Management System ISO14001 and are Forest Stewardship Council FSC chainofcustody certified.

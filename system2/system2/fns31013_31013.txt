STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Robert Walters plc 21 Its been exciting to see the market change over the past ten years. Interim management used to be considered the last career step for senior professionals before retirement but now we are seeing younger managers taking on interim roles to diversify their careers with new responsibilities they wouldnt necessarily have in a permanent job. One of the keys to our success has been the client focus Ive instilled in the team. Ive taught them to always challenge themselves and to never take anything for granted. We never assume that a client will be loyal to us we are always offering outstanding service. Determination is key as our team know that we never give up on a client. In the early days we focused on finance and accounting roles in Amsterdam. Today weve grown from three consultants to over 50 spread across three offices and six specialist divisions. One thing weve done well is anticipating market trends. We recognised that temp candidates were becoming more scarce so we decided to add value to our service by launching Walters People Academy. Its an elearning platform where our candidates can benefit from free educational programmes in finance languages and other areas.

Peacock Foods was acquired in December 2016 and the integration and synergy delivery is on track. Key investments in the period were the significant expansion in our Carol Stream Illinois facility to cater for a new contract win in meal kits and further expansion in our Romeoville Illinois facility. We have a strong commercial pipeline for our new enlarged network that allows us to exploit growth opportunities with both existing and new customers. Convenience Foods US division reported FY17 revenue growth of 295.0 to 0.9bn an increase of 5.9 on a pro forma basis. Pro forma volume growth a more meaningful indicator of underlying performance rose by approximately 7 and was driven by good category growth and business wins. Adjusted Operating Profit increased by 35.4m to 33.3m representing a margin of 3.8 470bps on FY16. We will complete the integration of Peacock Foods and will deliver the planned synergies associated with this. We will continue to leverage our fresh frozen and ambient capabilities to expand and extend our pipeline of commercial opportunities with existing and new customers particularly in the CPG channel while maintaining our reputation for excellent food safety and innovation. These opportunities coupled with an improving customer mix will help the US division to leverage its enlarged network footprint and wider capabilities to drive profitable growth and enhanced returns.

Enhance our leadership position in UK convenience food especially in food to go Our performance in the UK is underpinned by our leadership of the fastgrowing food to go category. Growth in the food to go category of 6.6 comfortably exceeded the 2.9 growth in the overall food market. The category continues to benefit from supportive underlying consumer trends and further growth in the space dedicated to food to go in supermarket and specialist channels. The Group has built strong longterm partnerships with our customers who are also looking to this category for growth. This is complemented by marketleading positions in convenience food categories including ready meals and cooking sauces. In recent years these businesses have benefitted from an increasing preference for private label products which have outpaced brands in their categories. We strengthened our leadership position and increased market share in the food to go category with several significant business wins commercial launches delivered to plan plus contracts extended with core customers. Capacity is in place for mediumterm growth in Food to Go having substantially completed a phase of network investment with key customers and having added further capacity through the acquisition of the Heathrow facility and the integration of the Atherstone facility. We also invested in the UK ready meals network to position for future growth and continued to rationalise our UK portfolio with the exit from the desserts manufacturing business in Evercreech. Convenience Foods UK Ireland division reported FY17 revenue growth of 14.3 to 1.4bn an increase of 11.9 on a pro forma basis. This was primarily driven by our Food to Go business which accounted for approximately 60 of divisional revenue in the period. Adjusted Operating Profit increased by 2.6 to 106.8m representing a margin of 7.4 90bps on FY16. As the operational disruption from network and commercial investment eases we will leverage the invested overhead to improve cost effectiveness and position ourselves for future volume growth. We will use our investment in consumer insight and additional capacity to grow the category in partnership with our customers. We will work with our customers to maximise product returns through collaborating on initiatives including sourcing ordering merchandising and waste management. We have moved to multiyear supply arrangements with our major customers to support this investment for the long term. Following investment in our ready meals category in FY17 due to complete in FY18 the priority is now to strengthen our strong positions with our key customers in that category. We will streamline and strengthen our UK divisional and cost structures. This will involve the implementation of a more compact divisional structure overhead reduction upgraded operational capability greater functional centralisation and standardisation.

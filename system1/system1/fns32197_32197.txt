The core of our strategy has been to generate strong investment performance for our investors over the long term deliver a first class service communicate clearly and frequently with our investors broaden our distribution deepen our client relationships and engagement and raise our brand awareness and profile. The expansion of the Company over the last financial year is evidence of the continued success of this strategy. We generated gross sales of more than 2 billion and net inflows of 482 million in the financial year to 31 March 2017 with our AuM increasing by 36 to 6.5 billion. The adjusted profit before tax increased by 18 to 17.2 million and revenues were up 15 to 51 million. At a time when the ability of asset managers to grow organically is being questioned these figures are especially pleasing. This is even more so when it is considered that our expansion over the past year has been achieved against a challenging background for selling equity funds in general and the UK All Companies sector in particular in the UK. The Investment Association reported that from April 2016 to March 2017 there were net retail outflows from equity funds in eight of the 12 months. The Investment Associations UK All Companies sector was the worst performing for net retail sales in seven of these months although it was the best seller in March 2017. The continued strength of our fund management capability is evidenced by our longterm performance. Take the Liontrust Special Situations Fund as an example. Since launch on 10 November 2005 to 31 March 2017 the Fund generated a total return of 333.28 compared to 118.64 by the FTSE AllShare index. Our other teams have delivered strong performance as well. The Cashflow Solutions European Growth Fund has returned 153.24 since launch on 15 November 2006 compared to 77.22 by the MSCI Europe ex UK index. These returns demonstrate the mistake of dismissing all active fund management. We have further expanded our fund management capability over the past year by completing the acquisition of the Argonaut European Income business and announcing the purchase of Alliance Trust Investments Limited ATI. The acquisition of ATI was completed on 1 April 2017 and added 2.5 billion to take our AuM to 9.1 billion on 3 April. The addition of the Sustainable Investment team gives us a strong proposition in an area of investment that we believe will only grow in demand and significance. According to the European SRI Study of 2016 11 trillion 9.5 trillion is currently invested in sustainable and responsible investment across Europe with 1.5 trillion coming from the UK. We now have a presence in many of the core asset classes for UK investors. These are UK and continental European growth funds equity income funds risktargeted solutions for investors seeking to accumulate wealth and in retirement and sustainable investment. We have also strengthened further our distribution capability in the UK and internationally. Ian Chimes joined us in February 2017 as Head of Global Distribution and he has recruited two regional salesmen for the North of England and Scotland and the Midlands. This will enhance our client service further through understanding and engaging with a broader range of clients. The brand awareness and understanding of Liontrust and the engagement with the Company has grown among intermediaries and consumers and reflects our distinct identity and strong messaging. This is being driven particularly by our advertising press coverage investor communications and sponsorships. Our new website and expanding digital activity will enhance further our marketing capability and engagement with intermediaries and consumers.

Outlook There has been much discussion about the squeezed middle in the asset management industry. Companies either have to be global players or niche boutiques to survive and prosper so goes the argument. We believe this is a simplistic and incorrect view of the development of the market. Liontrust is not alone in showing that you do not have to be a boutique or a global group to be able to generate growth year after year. We have also delivered value for our investors through strong fund performance over the long term. Following the investment we have made in the infrastructure of the business over the past few years Liontrust is now both larger and more robust and this will enable us to drive forward the next phase of our growth strategy.

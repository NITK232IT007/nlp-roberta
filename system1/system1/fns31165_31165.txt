This was an accounting loss only and meant we did not need to make any further cash injections. Profit before tax was up 3 to 8.1m 2016 7.9m with the underlying adjusted profit before tax up 20 to 11.0m 2016 9.2m. Interest costs were level year on year despite the increase in net debt. We also had a benefit from the weakness in Sterling on the translation of our overseas results. On a constant currency basis adjusted profit before tax was up 14 but reported profit before tax was down 2. Currency has been beneficial for the last two years following the Brexit vote but based on the exchange rates at year end we would not expect to see the same benefit during 2018. Diluted earnings per share was down 15 to 7.9p 2016 9.3p also impacted by the higher amortisation charges and loss on disposal. On an adjusted basis there was an 11 growth to 12.5p 2016 11.3p representing the sixth year of double digit percentage growth. Five year plan 20142018 NET FEE INCOME GROWTH Sustainable growth in net fee income is needed to deliver longterm growth in net profit and earnings per share. Target Average annual growth of 10. Progress 18 13 in constant currency. The last three years have been at or above our target level. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR Net fee income growth 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 3 5 10 20 18 CONVERSION RATIO This demonstrates how efficiently the business is operating and how well the cost base is being managed. It is calculated as the percentage of adjusted operating profit to net fee income. Target Reach 20 ratio by 2018. Progress 16.7 being the sixth consecutive year of improvement. After the small growth in 2017 we do not expect to reach 20 in 2018 but continue to focus on balancing costs productivity improvements and investments to grow net fee income to reach our target. Conversion ratio 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 14.2 14.9 16.3 16.6 16.7 As we enter 2018 we start the last year of our most recent five year growth plan. We are pleased with the progress we have made in all three key measures. We will continue to work on improving the conversion ratio and all three targets remain ongoing areas of focus for the Group. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR Strategic report Governance Financials 21 Focus into 2018 Organic growth has always been a core part of our business model and despite the low overall organic growth in the year this remains a key focus of management. We agree specific plans with each brand to help them develop into leading brands in their sectors and we will continue to invest in new staff locations and markets where we see opportunities to grow. We are confident that the plans we are following will help the Group deliver profitable organic growth in 2018. We have not made any external investments during 2017 concentrating on integrating the three investments we made over a 12 month period from October 2015 to October 2016. It was important to settle them into the Group before looking for new investment opportunities. With the main focus on organic growth in 2018 we do not currently expect to make any significant external investments but we will continue to work on identifying suitable opportunities to further develop the Group in line with our strategy. As part of balancing our sector and geographic coverage we have a particular interest in increasing our presence in the Latin American region and the healthcare and professional services sectors. We also work with our brands to identify and execute sector specific bolton acquisition opportunities to help accelerate their growth plans. Joost Kreulen Chief Executive Officer 13 March 2018 DEBT AS A OF DEBTORS This demonstrates how leveraged the Group is. The Group needs a sound financial foundation for longterm sustainability and to be able to react to opportunities in the market. Target To reduce this to 25 by 2018. Progress This increased to 45 from 38 in the prior year due to the acquisition based payments made in the year. Having reached the target in 2015 we took the decision to make two strategic investments using cash and debt in 2016 knowing this would significantly increase this ratio in the shortterm. We expect to see this rate reduce in 2018 but not to reach the target level. Total debt as of trade debtors 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 51 32 23 38 45 Over the first four years of our plan we have delivered a 63 growth in net fee income with 26 from organic growth for businesses in the Group in 2013 43 from new investments and 6 lost through divestments. The Boards decision to operate above the longterm debt to debtors target is explained in the Finance review. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR 22 Empresaria Group plc Annual Report Accounts 2017 Operating review United Kingdom Revenue increased by 24 and net fee income was up 23 helped by having a full year of contribution from ConSol Partners. However excluding this the underlying movement in net fee income was a reduction of 2 due to lower sales within our insurance and technical industrial brands. Our UK based brands in technical industrial merged at the beginning of 2017 and overall the integration has run smoothly. The sector has been challenging with candidate shortages and delays to key projects and at the same time the credit community has also been very cautious in this sector and this is unlikely to improve following recent well publicised company collapses. We are working closely with the business to help them make improvements in structure and process to recover their profit levels including the introduction of an improved training programme during the year. We plan to invest in adding more staff in 2018.

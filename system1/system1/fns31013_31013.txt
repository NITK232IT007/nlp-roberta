STRATEGIC REPORT 8 Robert Walters plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND DRIVERS TALENT SHORTAGES WORLDWIDE Talent shortages are set to intensify further even in countries experiencing modest growth. Demographic changes continue to be a key driver particularly across Asia. As the European job market begins to grow after ten years of stagnation the war for talent shows no sign of slowing. In talent short markets specialist recruitment firms can excel and are in greater demand to add value to the hiring process especially when compared to speculative channels like social media or advertising.

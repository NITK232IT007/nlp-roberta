Our priority now is to deliver significant growth in our first year as a listed business. Our strategy Our aim is to maximise production reserves and cash flow from our existing lowcost production base while pursuing sustainable growth and returns through active development and exploration programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean. We will achieve this while maintaining a disciplined financial framework and a conservative balance sheet.

The Prinos Basin licence was acquired in 2007 for US1.5 million plus acquired indebtedness. Since then we have secured a 25year licence extension and have increased reserves through the technical reappraisal of the reservoir with a new 3D campaign undertaken in 2015 as well as further drilling activity enabling us to implement our fullyfunded development plan to significantly increase production over the next three years. Energeans long track record in the Prinos basin operatorship of the majority of our assets and low operating costs per barrel underpins our ability to maximise cash flow from our reserves and resources.

Five years ago we were primarily a UK lines and calls business today we are offering communications possibilities that no one had even thought of back then to customers in 170 countries. Possibilities that really do enable them to lead fuller lives and run more protable innovative businesses. In a very short time weve gone from a narrowband xedline communications business to a broadband company harnessing the power of modern networks to help our customers communicate anywhere any time using whatever devices they happen to choose. Weve brought levels of choice and control to our customers at home at work or out and about that would once have seemed impossible. ................................................................................................................................................ Helping some of the worlds largest companies and organisations serve their customers around the world ................................................................................................................................................ Who would have thought ve years ago that BT would be offering nextgeneration digital TV over broadband Our BT Vision service enables customers to watch what they want when they want without having to pay a monthly subscription. Who would have thought that our customers would have been beneting from intelligent seamless xedmobile communications like BT Fusion at home at work or in between chatting swapping data surng the internet doing business Who would have thought that we would be helping some of the worlds largest companies and organisations do business and serve their customers around the world Who would have thought that geography would be history and time irrelevant But the thing about transformation however radical and however successful is that there is no end point. No moment at which you can sit back and think job done. Even when we hit ve million broadband connections in 2005 more than a year ahead of schedule there was no time to take it easy. Today that number is around 11 million and climbing. Our broadband success sums up the type of company BT is becoming. A company that goes the extra mile that rallies behind its goals that nds ways of meeting its customers needs locally nationally internationally and globally. FROM OUR TIME TO YOUR TIME Nothing is more important than offering a great customer experience rst time every time. It differentiates BT from the competition it is what the BT brand stands for. Excellent customer service can only be delivered in customer time the time that customers want. Quite rightly customers have no interest in or patience with our time the time it takes our systems to make it happen. Meeting customers needs in customer time is vital to proving that we understand them share their priorities and enthusiasms and really do put them rst. This type of realtime customer experience is best delivered by software. In the future BTs services will increasingly be based on software designed delivered and updated remotely by computers over broadband networks. These services will be faster more innovative reliable and simpler to use often delivered by the push of a button. These softwaredriven networked IT services will be delivered over our global twentyrst century broadband network. We have set ourselves the target of becoming number one for customer service within two years. To ensure that we continue to think and act in customer time two measures will apply throughout the company and keep everyone focused. First we will measure how successfully we get things right rst time. Second we will measure the improvements we make in the cycle time the time between the start and end of any customer experience. Overview Chief Executives statement BT has been capturing the imaginations of customers shareholders analysts suppliers and employees around the world. Weve done this by embracing change. By demonstrating not only that we can thrive on it but that we can help our customers thrive on it as well. Weve done it by proving that when it comes to modern communications the possibilities really are endless. And weve done it by being a company that is driven by its customers shifting power and choice to them. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We are open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. We are working with suppliers industry partners and others with a single compelling objective to get the best possible services to our customers around the world as quickly as possible. Customers dont care about whether any given service was designed by W manufactured by X delivered by Y and billed for by Z. They care about what it can do for them whether it makes life easier or a business more protable. CITIZENS OF A GLOBAL VILLAGE All our customers private individuals families and large corporations are increasingly thinking and behaving like global citizens. They want the world on their PC laptop or hand held device. And they want to be able to organise themselves and do business build markets and win customers as and where it suits them. ................................................................................................................................................ A truly global software driven services company ................................................................................................................................................ And meeting their global needs means ensuring that we really do understand them that we really can get inside their heads. For consumer customers global communication means being able to keep in touch and access information whether they are in York or New York Mumbai or Rome. For modern organisations global communication means the opportunity to take advantage of the best resources and talents wherever they are located.

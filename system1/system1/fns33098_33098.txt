At the time of our last half year results we highlighted that the then current interest rate environment was extraordinarily low. Since then rates have approximately halved and there is a general acknowledgement that these rates are likely to stay low for longer than was hitherto expected. Such a background to the operation of a high yielding property business is outside the experience of most people working today but the likelihood must be that it will provide scope for continued yield compression and further liquidity in the property sector. Improvements in both the occupational and investor markets across all three of our core regions have enabled the business to produce another year of record results James Hambro Chairman 6 March 2015 8 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Chairmans Review Joint Chief Executives Review and Finance Report The Group has completed 583.0 million of sales and purchases during 2014. The increase in investor appetite for multilet light industrial property particularly in the UK has enabled us to sell pro tably 315.3 million of property. Despite increased competition we have still managed to acquire 267 .7 million of property on terms that we believe offer excellent value and future growth potential. At the property level our portfolio that is owned or coowned comprises 4.2 million sq m or 45.4 million sq ft at a passing yield of 8.5 occupancy of 86.0 and over 6000 tenants none of whom account for more than 1 .2 of the entire rent roll. All three regions UK Germany and Benelux made signi cant contributions to the nancial success in 2014. Our management platform now comprises 15 of ces spread across Europe which is an enormous asset to the business and an acknowledged market leader at managing this type of property. Implementing the strategy Executive Directors Ian Watson Morgan Jones Richard Lowes 2014 was an outstanding year for Hansteen Normalised Total Pro t of 65.3 million and EPRA NAV in excess of 700 million are at record levels. This was all achieved against a backdrop of the falling Euro. Joint Chief Executive Joint Chief Executive Finance Director 9 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Joint Chief Executives Review and Finance Report 2014 2013 m m Rental income 78.8 78.4 Cost of sales 14.3 12.4 Management fees 6.0 3.2 Share of associates 10.8 3.7 Overheads 20.0 16.9 Net interest payable 13.1 16.6 Normalised Income Pro t 48.2 39.4 Pro t on sale of investment properties 10.5 6.8 Loss on sale of trading properties 0.2 Total pro ts on sale of investment and trading properties 10.3 6.8 Other operating income 6.8 0.1 Normalised Total Pro t 65.3 46.3 IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY Hansteen has a buy work and sell business model. We endeavour to buy assets when they are at a relatively low point both in relation to the property cycle and at the asset level. In particular we like to buy properties with a vacant element. We then apply our particular brand of intensive management to increase the occupancy increase the rent and reduce the irrecoverable costs. Ideally we then crystallise the value added at a relatively strong point in the cycle. In the years 2008 to 2013 the markets were both depressed and distressed. During that period we acquired 1 .6 billion of property and sold 649.0 million from the owned or coowned portfolio. The acquisition prices paid were low and in virtually all cases the acquisitions were directly or indirectly from banks that had taken control following a borrower defaulting on a loan. In 2014 with the market gathering momentum the gures were 315.3 million sold and 267 .7 million purchased. Given a market with improving liquidity all aspects of our strategy were positive. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIS FINANCIAL KPIS We believe that returns are best measured by looking at normalised pro ts and valuation growth. Normalised Total Pro t for the year to 31 December 2014 increased by 41 .0 to 65.3 million 2013 46.3 million. Normalised Income Pro t which excludes pro ts or losses from the sale of properties i.e. essentially the repeatable earnings of the business increased by 22.3 to 48.2 million 2013 39.4 million. This is the ninth consecutive year in which Hansteens Normalised Income Pro t has increased. Normalised Income Pro t per share increased by 14.5 to 7 .1p 2013 6.2p. The table below sets out the results for Normalised Income Pro t and Normalised Total Pro t including our share of associates. 10 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC Joint Chief Executives Review and Finance Report In addition to pro ts in 2014 all regions produced positive valuation growth. The total uplift of 135.8 million was the highest in any year for Hansteen. As a result the Groups EPRA Net Asset Value at 31 December 2014 was 102p per share 2013 91p an increase of 12.1. This combined with dividends paid in the year of 5.4 equates to a return in excess of 17.0. Excluding adverse currency movement and the LTIP provision the underlying performance increased by more than 20.0. PROPERTY PORTFOLIO In total the portfolio that is owned or coowned by Hansteen is valued at 1 .6 billion has a rent roll of 137 .7 million per annum and 14.0 vacancy. If the portfolio was fully occupied at our view of market rents the rent roll would be 171 .4 million per annum reecting a yield of 10.6. Hansteens attributable property investments at 31 December 2014 was valued at 1 .2 billion 2013 1 .1 billion. Had the currency remained unchanged throughout the year the portfolio would have been worth an additional 59.1 million. At 31 December 2014 this attributable portfolio comprised 3.2 million sq m an increase from 2.8 million sq m at the start of the year mainly due to the acquisitions in Germany and the Netherlands. The portfolio has a yield of 8.6 2013 8.7.

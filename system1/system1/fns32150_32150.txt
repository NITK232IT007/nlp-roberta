EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM See Markets p10 for further information See Governance Report p46 for further information 03 INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STABILITY AND VISIBILITY STRONG GROWTH IN BILLINGS DRIVES DEFERRED REVENUE Billings have accelerated in recent years following a significant investment in innovation and our partner channel. Billings are closely aligned with cash flows and are an indicator of growth in the business. Subscription contracts represent approximately 81 percent of total billings and around 75 percent of total billings are derived from existing customers. The average subscription contract duration consistent with prioryear is close to 28 months resulting in the majority of the contract value being booked to deferred revenue to be recognised over the contracts lifetime. This adds to the high levels of visibility into future revenues and profits. NEW BILLINGS AND HARDWARE SALES Continued strong growth in new billings 21 percent in FY17 and c.40k customers added This is principally driven by a strong customer proposition as well as the increasing productivity of our 30000 strong partner channel of which 6100 are now blue chip. Hardware sold to existing and new customers generally refreshes in line with subscriptions. Principally a subscription business ...

Our significant growth in billings and free cash flow over the previous financial year was driven by ongoing investment in organic and acquired product innovation. This growth continues to fuel a strengthening talent pool and an extended reach of our selling and marketing operations. Cybersecurity remains a top priority for organisations of every size and our rigorous focus on delivering enterprisegrade IT security to midmarket enterprises via the channel that serves them differentiates and strongly positions Sophos in the enormous and growing global IT security market. This past year we have made strong progress against our strategic goals in both our enduser and network security offerings. We have added significant customer value and expanded our market opportunity across our product lines through numerous product enhancements and additions including through Sophos Central our rapidly growing borninthecloud offering. As we look ahead we have a robust product roadmap with planned offerings that will incorporate nextgeneration machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies which will further differentiate Sophos and strengthen the value we deliver to our customers and channel partners. We have also strengthened our Board by welcoming two highly qualified UKbased global executives as independent nonexecutive directors. Vin Murria joined our Board in January and serves on our nomination and remuneration committees. Vin is a successful entrepreneur with strong operational leadership experience in growing UKbased global technology businesses and associated shareholder value.

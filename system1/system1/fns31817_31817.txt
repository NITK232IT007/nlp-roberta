Our portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications continues to grow annually. We supplement our inhouse innovation where appropriate by inlicensing and potentially by targeted acquisition. Customers We assist customers in exploiting the full benefit of CFQD quantum dot products in their displays in order to achieve wide colour gamut energy efficiency and brightness thus significantly improving the customers product offering. Partners We work with our partners to enable them to fully exploit our technology thereby maximising their opportunity to generate revenues and profits in a market that is forecast to grow rapidly. Employees We aim to attract develop and retain the best talent recognise and reward success value the diverse contributions of our people create an environment where people feel trusted safe supported and healthy and share values that reflect what matters to our people. Shareholders We are strongly positioned to compete in the display market. Our strategy in this market represents a strong growth opportunity by creating a highly scalable product offering whilst maintaining margins. Whilst our focus is primarily on the display market at present we fully expect our platform technology to address other markets once we succeed in the display market. Our key strengths How we create value c. 600 patents grantedpending 11 Nanoco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 12 Strategic report CONTINUED GROWTH IN DISPLAY OUR MARKETS The key market for our CFQD technology at present and for the near future is the display sector. 22.5M 400M 46 QD TV shipments are forecast to grow from c. 4 million in 2016 to 22.5 million in 2021. This equates to a market opportunity for QD materials of 400 million in 2021. Sales of medium and larger displays 46 and above continue to grow. The display market The display market includes televisions monitors notebooks tablets and smartphones Stronger demand for large ultrahighdefinition UHD and 8K panels could slow declining average selling prices Global display demand could pick up after 2016 if global economy improves Flat panel display FPD area is expected to grow as demand for large TVs rises Samsung and LG were the major brands sold in 2016 followed by Chinas Hisense and TCL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 Nanoco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 QD display market forecast by application volume 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Smartphone Tablet 0.3 Notebook 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 Monitor 0.2 1.1 1.0 1.4 2.0 2.7 3.3 TV 1.2 4.0 7.4 11.6 15.1 19.1 22.5 Millions of units 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 QD display market forecast by type volume 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 QDCF 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.7 QD surface 1.3 3.9 8.3 12.7 16.1 20.3 23.6 QD edge 0.4 1.3 0.1 QD chip 0.3 0.8 1.2 1.7 Millions of units NANOCO AWARDED GRANT FROM INNOVATE UK FOR MAJOR LIFE SCIENCES PROJECT LIFE SCIENCE S Nanoco has been awarded a major grant from Innovate UK the UKs innovation agency to support its ongoing research into the use of quantum dot nanoparticles within cancer imaging. The research project that has received the grant entitled VIVODOTS nanodevices for detection resection and management of pancreatic cancers is a continued collaboration between Nanoco and University College London UCL the Groups long time partner in the life sciences sector and builds on the significant progress Nanocos Life Sciences team has made on invivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes and breast cancer imaging. The total value of the grant over the threeyear project is 1.15 million of which 807815 is attributable to Nanoco and 345439 to UCL. Nanoco will receive 60 of its share from Innovate UK in cash over the threeyear period. Display market opportunity As shown in the tables below independent forecasts of the growth of the application of quantum dot products in the display market show significant anticipated growth over the next five years and the majority of this growth is anticipated to be in QD surface products i.e. film containing quantum dots.

STRATEGIC REPORT 14 Strategic report MAXIMISING OUR OPPORTUNITY OUR S TRATE GY Nanocos strategy is to focus on meeting the needs of its customers through the application of its scientific knowhow and innovative CFQD technology. Grow revenue Revenue growth is key to the Group becoming selfsustaining financially while continuing to invest in RD for future products. Primarily focus on display industry The display industry is the most developed market for our products and we are tightly focused on this market. External analysts forecast significant growth for CFQD applications in the display industry in the future. The Group operates a hybrid strategy of technology licensing nonexclusively to Dow and Merck and own manufacture and direct supply to service the display industry. This hybrid strategy allows the widest coverage of the Groups technology in the display field. Continue to invest in RD Investment in RD to improve current products and also to develop new products remains a key part of our strategy. Patents Patents protect our high quality IP and we continue to create new IP and protect existing IP to maintain our competitive advantages. Develop inhouse capability and capacity We have invested in expanding our manufacturing capacity and inhouse production remains a key part of our strategy. Growth Investment Performance in 2017 Whilst billings fell by 0.8 million compared to last year to 1.1 million revenues grew by 179 compared to 2016 to 1.3 million. Revenues remain modest compared to the opportunity ahead of us and the market has been slower to develop than envisaged. Performance in 2017 RD expenditure fell in 2017 compared to 2016 due to cost savings implemented as a result of the cash position of the Company nevertheless important progress was made during the year especially in improvements in product performance.

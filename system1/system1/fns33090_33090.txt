There were approximately 5.7 billion of shopping centre transactions in 2014 25 higher than 2013 and the highest annual total since 2006. 2 Shopping habits continue to change in a multichannel retail environment. In 2014 Black Friday was firmly established but the failure of City Link alongside profit warnings by pure play online operators point to the fragility of the home delivery model. The popularity of Click Collect has increased for example it now forms 56 of John Lewis online sales. Across the CR portfolio 70 of our occupiers now offer this service up from 58 in 2013. So whilst according to CBRE research over 50 of consumers from all age groups shop online they do so as part of a multichannel approach and the importance of the physical store remains clear. CR has been at the forefront of embracing and developing technical innovations such as WiFi websites apps and social media to benefit and complement the physical retail environment. Whilst Beacons Augmented Reality and Wearables push their way into the psyche of the UK consumer whats clear is that a trip to the shops engaging all physical senses provides a good antidote to what otherwise could be everyday digital overload. The need for the physical was played out this Christmas with increased sales of books and records reported by leading retailers. To be truly relevant within a community our centres are increasingly stretching beyond retail and car parks leisure office hotel gym and latterly residential are all part of the offer that we continue to develop. With over 20 of our income now coming from uses beyond retail the relevance and robustness of our income stream in the context of the town centre continues to strengthen. All the evidence points to the importance of our schemes as retail led hubs fulfilling social and experiential needs as well as the more traditional but equally important requirements of convenience security and value.

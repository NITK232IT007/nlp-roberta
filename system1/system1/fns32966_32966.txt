The equity fundraise announced post year end raised an additional net US16.5 million providing funding for the planned drilling in Q4 2018 of Prospect S in Namibia. During 2017 the Group continued with the development of its portfolio and business by investing c.US13 million into its exploration portfolio and administration activities 31 December 2016 c.US17 million primarily in the 2D and 3D seismic campaign in Morocco. The timely acquisition of seismic data in Morocco allowed the Group to fulfil its commitments early in the licence phases at historically low rates again demonstrating strong capital discipline and leveraging the technical expertise and value additive work of the highly experienced industry respected inhouse team. The recovery of the Rabat Deep investment costs received on completion of the farmout to Eni in January 2017 was supported by careful stewardship of existing cash balances as the effects of the 2016 restructuring and continued focus on cost saving led to further reductions in annual cash overheads before any recovery from partners to US4.2 million down from US5.0 million in 2016. As at 31 December 2017 US7.6 million of the Groups cash balances were held as security against licence work commitments. The increase from US6.2 million as at 31 December 2016 was primarily due to the award of the Kenitra licence in 2017. In February 2018 US4.0 million of Moroccan bank guarantees were released. Financial Performance Year Ended 31 December 2017 The Groups loss after tax for the year to 31 December 2017 was US55.4 million which is US48.6 million higher than the US6.8 million loss incurred for the year ended 31 December 2016. The vast majority of this US48.6 million increase in the annual loss is due to an impairment charge of US51.3 million against previously capitalised costs in the Namibian Southern Blocks due its relinquishment in August 2017 compared with a US5.2 million impairment charge in Mauritania in 2016 together with a reduction in net finance income of US2.7 million combined with an overall reduction in share based payments other administrative expenses and tax expense totalling US0.2 million. This equates to a loss per share of US0.21 compared to a loss per share of US0.03 in 2016. The share based payments charge of US0.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 in relation to employee deferred share awards was broadly consistent with US0.8 million in the previous year. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW INVESTING IN THE FUTURE 2017 saw Chariot develop its portfolio further towards its goal for the delivery of transformational growth. Through our continued strict adherence to our risk management strategy we have been able to continue to invest in the portfolio and apply the appropriate risk reduction technologies whilst maintaining a robust cash balance US15.2m Cash at 31 December 2017 US4.2m Annual Cash overhead reduced from US9.4m 2013 US4.2m 2017 Investing in the Future With US15.2 million of cash at 31 December 2017 no debt and no commitments across the entirety of the portfolio the Group is well funded. In March 2018 this balance sheet was further bolstered by an equity raise of US16.5 million net allowing funding for the drilling of Prospect S in Namibia and acting as a potential catalyst for future partnering discussions. We thus look forward to an exciting year with the continuation of the Companys drilling programme providing additional value triggers and the possibility for Chariots giant potential prospect inventory to be realised. Julian MauriceWilliams Chief Financial Officer STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 Chariot Oil Gas Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Other administrative expenses of US3.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 is US0.1 million lower due to ongoing costs savings 31 December 2016 US3.5 million. The finance income and expense net gain of US0.2 million 31 December 2016 US2.8 million net gain comprises interest on cash and foreign exchange movements on nonUS cash. Interest income of US0.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 is significantly lower than the prior year as the vast majority of the Groups cash is now held at lower interest rates in US Dollars as compared with the significant Brazilian Real cash balance held throughout 2016 earning a higher interest rate 31 December 2016 US1.2 million. The foreign exchange loss on nonUS cash of less than US0.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 is also indicative of the Group holding the majority of its cash in US Dollars. In the prior year significant cash balances were held in Brazilian Real as security against licence work commitments resulting in a higher foreign exchange movement 31 December 2016 US1.6 million gain. The tax expense of less than US0.1 million in the year to 31 December 2017 31 December 2016 US0.2 million relates to Brazilian taxation levied on interest income with its decrease consistent with lower Brazilian interest income received in 2017. Exploration and Appraisal Assets as at 31 December 2017 During the year to 31 December 2017 the carrying value of the Groups exploration and appraisal assets decreased by US46.9 million to US72.8 million from US119.7 million as at 31 December 2016. This US46.9 million decrease was due to the US51.3 million impairment charge against the Southern Blocks and US3.0 million of farmin proceeds in Rabat Deep Morocco partly offset by US7.3 million of portfolio investment undertaken in 2017. The US7.3 million portfolio investment is split as follows in Morocco US5.8 million was incurred mainly on 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and processing in Namibia US0.9 million was incurred across all the Groups licences with the majority relating to the Central Blocks 3D seismic interpretation and preparations to drill and in Brazil US0.6 million was incurred mainly on the 3D seismic interpretation.

Ian Wilson Chief Executive Officer Chief Executives statement 07 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Growing and developing our hybrid network EweMove provides estate agency and lettings services 247 through an integrated platform and a franchised network of local property experts. Change 2017 saw the active recruitment of experienced estate agents for the first time 15 recruited. At the midyear Nick Neill took the helm as MD following the founders departure. Nick was one of the first franchisees and was running one of the most successful franchises. Not all franchisees accepted the changes but the flow of new franchisees attracted by the technology and ethos continued. Progress We have focused on the core activities refining what worked and creating operational efficiencies. Losses in H1 were significantly offset by profits in H2 net loss 0.1m. Renewed vigour saw the franchise network increase to 120 franchises by year end. The 2 key areas of focus moving ahead are accelerated growth in the national footprint of local property experts and enhancing franchise performance. Number of franchises 120 25 2016 96 These figures are not quoted on a likeforlike basis. In all 178 traditional brand offices grew their revenue yearonyear and 105 offices had static or shrinking revenue. We had 3 franchisees managing 800 properties 21 franchisees managing 500 and 59 franchisees managing 300. The overall pattern was of pleasing revenue growth in a marketplace where many competitors were reportedly in reverse gear. However we can not be complacent. Whilst our best franchisees made good progress other franchisees found trading conditions difficult. Management are alive to the possibility that there will be both opportunities for our franchisees to act as consolidators at their local level buying up competitors letting portfolios but there will also be consolidation opportunities within the Group with strong and capable franchisees buying out their weaker neighbours.

This provides us with exciting opportunities for growth in a diverse range of markets and with a strong motivation to make a positive difference to peoples lives worldwide. We have a clear growth strategy a simple financial model and a unique organisational structure which is customerfocused and enables us to adapt quickly to market changes. Halma has had a wellestablished financial target that aims to double our earnings every five years without becoming highly geared or seeking further equity provided there are similar rates of organic acquisitive and dividend growth. This aspiration pushes our businesses to deliver sustainable revenue growth by increasing investment in innovation talent and international expansion rather than limiting their focus only on operational efficiency and shortterm profitability. Over the past five years we have achieved compound annual growth rates of 10 for revenue and 11 for profit with a good balance between organic acquisition and dividend growth. This strong performance reflects not only our sound growth strategy but also the exceptional commitment abilities and dedication of talented individuals in every part of Halma.

Growth in all major regions A major benefit for businesses within Halma is the support they receive to build their business in key export markets. This year once again this was reflected in the widespread revenue growth achieved in both developing and developed regions. There was impressive growth in Asia Pacific where revenue increased 21 to 152m 2016 125m including 9 organic constant currency growth. Revenue from China was up by 25 to 68m 2016 54m with 11 organic constant currency growth. Revenue from Other regions grew by 16 to 99m 2016 86m with good growth in Canada. Revenue from Mainland Europe grew by 17 to 210m 2016 179m including 6 organic constant currency growth while UK revenue was up by 7 to 155m 2016 145m with 5 organic constant currency growth. The USA remained our largest regional market with revenue increasing by 27 to 345m 2016 273m and 1 organic constant currency growth. Growth in all four sectors There was revenue and profit growth in all four sectors. All sectors achieved record revenue and all except Process Safety also generated record profit. The Medical sector became our largest profit sector for the first time with profit 2 up by 29 to 66.7m 2016 51.7 including 6 organic constant currency growth. Revenue grew by 31 to 261m 2016 199m with organic constant currency growth of 4. Return on Sales remained strong at 25.6 2016 26.0. Regionally the highest rate of organic constant currency revenue growth was in Asia Pacific and there was good progress in China. There were lower rates of organic growth in the UK and the USA which is the largest region representing 52 of the sector. There was a small organic constant currency decline in Mainland Europe. Visiometrics and CenTrak acquired in December 2015 and February 2016 respectively delivered improved performances as the year progressed. Infrastructure Safety profit 2 grew by an impressive 17 to 65.1m 2016 55.6m and revenue rose by 19 to 315m 2016 265m. Both included organic constant currency growth of 7. Return on Sales was 20.7 2016 21.2. There was strong organic constant currency revenue growth in Asia Pacific the UK and Mainland Europe the largest region at 30 of the sector supported by excellent progress from our Fire and Door Safety businesses. There was organic constant currency revenue decline in the USA partly due to a weaker performance from our Fire businesses including Firetrace which we acquired in October 2015. We have continued to strengthen Firetraces management team from within Halma and we expect its performance to improve as we move through 2017. We remain confident in its longerterm growth potential especially in international markets.

On a personal note I have elected to step down as CEO at the end of August 2017. I have spent a wonderful threeplus years in the role and leave the business in a strong position to contribute to and benefit from the future of India. I have always seen this extraordinary country as the next great growth vector and my experiences here have only reinforced that view. I believe Vedanta will continue to be the premier opportunity for those investing in India and I look forward to watching the Companys progress in the exciting years ahead. T om Albanese Chief Executive Officer 24 May 2017 22 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report FY2017 MARKET REVIEW INDIA IS A KEY MARKET FOR VEDANT A AND ONE WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS HUGE GROWTH POTENTIAL. SUST AINED ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT GREA TER PROSPERITY AND AN OVERALL INCREASE IN PERCAPIT A SPENDING. GLOBAL ECONOMY AND COMMODITY MARKETS Despite a series of economic and political shocks during the year which resulted in volatility in global markets the commodities index ended the fiscal year 25 higher as a result of a more positive macroeconomic environment. The global economy was boosted by an improvement in the US economy and a commitment to infrastructure spending by the new administration financial reforms and the introduction of stimulus measures in China aimed at keeping its economy on track. This uplift in global economic activity has increased demand for commodities in particular Iron Ore Aluminium Copper and Oil Gas leading to higher prices. In addition as a result of the negative environment over the past few years and limited investment by mining companies a lack of new mining projects coming on stream is leading to supply pressures for some commodities particularly zinc. We therefore expect to see continued tightening in the markets over the next few years as demand starts to exceed supply. OUTLOOK While there will be some volatility we expect commodity markets to remain robust following last years rally and the recovery in the global economy in the fourth quarter of 2016 to continue to gain momentum leading to higher levels of employment and rising incomes. According to the IMFs World Economic Outlook WEO global growth is projected to increase from an estimated 3.1 in 2016 to 3.5 in 2017 and 3.6 in 2018. This is an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point for 2017 relative to WEO October 2016. In advanced economies this pickup will largely be driven by the United States. Post the United States election expectations of higher spending on critical infrastructure US1 trillion infrastructure plan over 10 years and relaxed fiscal policy are fuelling expectations of higher growth. Emerging market and developing economies are also set to experience a pickup in activity on the back of the partial recovery in commodity prices and this will be a key factor in global growth. According to the IMF emerging and developing economies now account for more than 75 of global growth in output and consumption almost double the share of just two decades ago. Chinas growth trajectory as has been the case for many years also plays an important role. Chinese growth forecasts were revised upwards in October 2016 and the Chinese economy is now projected to grow at 6.6 in 2017 and 6.2 in 2018. This growth will support commodity prices in the shortterm. Vedantas diversified lowcost portfolio and attractive basket of commodities positions us well to take advantage of the recent economic uplift.. 23 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report FY2017 www.vedantaresources.com STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 LME Q12015 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q12016 Q2 Q3 Q4 Jan 17 Feb 17 Mar 17 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 US Midwest DDUP MJP ALUMINIUM PREMIA PREMIUM USt LME USt Source Platts and Metal Bulletin ALUMINIUM Global aluminium demand excluding China grew by 3 yearonyear in 2016 while Chinese demand grew by 7 last year driven by stronger primary demand supported by stimulus measures.

INDIAN ECONOMY India is a key market for Vedanta and one which we believe has huge growth potential. According to the IMF WEO April 2017 India is expected to grow by 7 .2 in FY2017 and 7 .7 in FY2018. It remains the fastestgrowing major economy in the world and is now ranked the worlds top investment destination by EY. Confidence in its growth story is increasing as the Government continues to drive reforms such as the introduction of Goods and Services Tax GST that encourage development. In addition enhanced transparency accountability an auctionbased forward looking framework and liberalisation of the Foreign Direct Investment FDI policy will help unlock Indias economic potential. As a result Indias medium term growth prospects are favourable. Sustained economic growth will lead to development greater prosperity and an overall increase in percapita spending.

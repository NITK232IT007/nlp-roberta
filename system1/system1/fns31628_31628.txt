I believe our performance in 2017 shows that the strategy is working and we are slightly ahead of schedule. We have been able to speed up the strategy because of the financial independence that resulted from DMGTs decision to reduce its holding in Euromoney which they completed in January and by investing some of the benefit from the strengthened US dollar compared to sterling. We have delivered a return to growth with both yearonyear revenue and profit ahead of 2016 though this included significant help from exchange rates. We remained focused on our use of capital by investing in the big themes such as our acquisition of RISI and disinvesting from areas which would otherwise create a drag. We have also made good progress fixing structurally challenged businesses and returning them to growth.

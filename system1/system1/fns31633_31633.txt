Employees across Avon have worked tirelessly to deliver these results and I would like to thank them all for their commitment and support. STRATEGY The Board has focused on refining the Groups strategy during the year. In broad terms our strategy is to grow the core by maximising organic sales growth from our current product portfolio supported by selective product development and through value enhancing acquisitions to complement and extend the reach of our existing businesses and to bring new growth opportunities. Delivery of this strategy requires us to manage the impact of the end of the ten year solesource contract with the US Department of Defense for the M50 respirator which we are well prepared for. The investments we have made in recent years to broaden our Protection product portfolio to support a wider range of Military programmes both in the US and in other countries gives the Board confidence that we will continue to deliver against our organic growth targets driving longterm profitable growth and providing sustainable value for our shareholders. 2017 was another strong year of delivery and we look to the future with confidence.

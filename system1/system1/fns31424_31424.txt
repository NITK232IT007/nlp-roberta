In order to maintain the quality we strive to acquire LLVs with portfolios that comprise quality syndicates thereby having to pay the average auction prices. Participations on weaker syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to maintain the overall quality. The six largest participations with the leading managing agents at Lloyds account for 79 of the portfolio. These participations in syndicates managed by these managing agents represent shares in the better managed businesses at Lloyds. Helios Underwriting plc Annual report and financial statements 2017 8 Reinsurance quota share The use of quota share reinsurance to provide access to the Lloyds underwriting exposures for reinsurers and private capital has been expanded. The core of the panel of reinsurers remains XL Group plc and Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited. This reinsurance reduces the exposure of the portfolio and assists in the financing of the underwriting capital. Helios will seek to reinsure a significant proportion of the capacity at the start of the underwriting year to mitigate the openyear underwriting exposures. For corporate members acquired during the year a proportion of the onrisk capacity will be ceded to reinsurers whilst the capacity on older years will be retained 100 by Helios Therefore the proportion of the overall capacity that Helios retains is expected to rise as further corporate members are acquired in the future. The profits earned after the company has been acquired will be recognised by Helios. The table shows that the Helios retained capacity increases significantly in years 2 and 3 as further corporate members are acquired and the older years are not reinsured. Capacity on underwriting years after 18 months of development is substantially off risk as the underlying insurance contracts have mostly expired. Therefore the profits from the capacity on the older years are retained 100 by Helios. The proportion of overall capacity retained by Helios for the 2016 and 2017 underwriting years is expected to increase to approximately 50 as further corporate members are acquired.

The managing agents have traditionally been conservative in the estimation of the profitability of a year of account waiting until the development of the underlying reserves for the claims can be assessed with greater certainty. The capacity acquired on the offrisk years that is retained 100 by Helios contributes a significant part of the profits of the Group. The chart below indicates that a significant proportion of the improvement in the estimates of profitability of syndicates are declared by the managing agents in the last 12 months to the close of an underwriting year. Even though the 2017 underwriting year has incurred significant catastrophe losses and is currently forecast to close at an overall loss for the underwriting year at 36 months the loss recognised at 12 months for 2017 of approximately 15 of capacity is higher that the ultimate expected loss to be declared at 36 months. Therefore when Helios will benefit from profits recognised from the 12 month stage on 2017 underwriting year. Quality of portfolio continued The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio have on average outperformed the Lloyds market average. Helios average return on capacity over the last three closed years is 14.2 and is on average 5.4 higher than the average of the Lloyds market. The combined ratio of the portfolio before Helios corporate costs has been 5.79 lower on average over the last three calendar years. These incremental returns demonstrate the diversity and breadth of underwriting expertise within the businesses comprising the portfolio of syndicate capacity.

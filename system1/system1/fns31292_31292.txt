We have further integrated the social business in H2 2017 with the creation of a shared development path which now allows us to deliver content simultaneously to both real money gaming and social audiences. The first offering in this regard is Slingo Arcade which following launch in late Q416 has become our highest grossing social app with very encouraging metrics. In future emphasis will be on using this channel to monetize content developed for real money gaming similar to licensing our content to third party operators. This has resulted in a reduction in Social Publishing headcount from 53 in June 2016 to 19 in December 2017. With the reduction in costs and marketing we have seen revenues fall 13 however this delivered a reduced full year EBITDA loss of 0.1m 2016 1.8m. Key goals for 2018 Continued profitability in Real Money Gaming and Social Publishing following 2017 cost reductions and operational improvements Continue strategic investment in Slingo Originals content library for overall revenue growth but with greater emphasis on content licensing Increase B2B partners on Grizzly platform Increase new licensees for Slingo Original content Further expansion of strategic media partnerships across all revenue streams Patrick Southon Chief Executive Officer 4 June 2018 Market overview We are continuing to focus on the younger more casual gambling demographic. We are targeting them through mobile delivery and original game IP. This is enabling us to acquire and engage players away from the more crowded male orientated sportsbook market. The 25 to 34 yearold group are our largest segment accounting for over 40 of all players. As a result of our content strategy women are delivering higher lifetime values on the platform despite the fact that the active players male to female ratio is 5050.

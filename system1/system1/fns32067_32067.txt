Gross margin Adjusted gross margin decreased marginally by 0.2 from 28.1 for the year ended 30 April 2016 to 27.9 for the year ended 30 April 2017. Adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of unrealised gains and losses on outstanding forward foreign currency contracts valued at the Balance Sheet date. The decrease of 0.2 is mainly due to In order to reduce the impact of the adverse movements in both the US and Euro exchange rates we entered into a significant volume of forward currency contracts ahead of and following the EU referendum selling Sterling and purchasing both US and Euros. This coupled with favourable Parent Reel pricing delivered a 0.3 improvement in adjusted gross margin. We have continued to invest in production head count to support the sales growth at a cost of 0.5 of adjusted gross margin. Administration costs Administrative costs have increased year on year by 2.6m to 15.6m mainly due a 1.1m increase in exceptional costs 0.6m due to increased wage costs as we continue to invest in people to support the sales growth 0.3m due to plc related running costs and 0.6m due to insurance depreciation and utilities. Exceptional costs of 1.6m in the current year relate to AIM flotation costs of 0.2m balance of 1.6m is included in the share premium account consulting costs of 0.6m an early settlement fee on finance leases of 0.4m and the writeoff of previous deal related costs attached to the previous debt structure of 0.4m. Distribution costs Distribution costs as a percentage of revenue has increased year on year by 0.5 to 8.5. The increase is mainly due to destination mix change with an increased number of southern depots coupled with an increased usage of packaging materials. Finance costs Finance costs have decreased significantly year on year by 3.8m to 1.1m mainly due to the restructuring of the debt at listing on AIM in June 2016.

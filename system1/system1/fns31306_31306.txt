After the operational successes of 2017 and the increased production output during the year we are looking forward to achieving further successes in the development activities planned for 2018 and delivering a steadily increasing production and revenue stream in the future. In conclusion on behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our staff for the continued dedication and support they have shown during the year. Chris Hopkinson Chairman REGAL PETROLEUM PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 02 Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 2 08052018 163804 26054.02 8 May 2018 257 PM Proof 5 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT Introduction The Group has made good progress at its Ukrainian fields during 2017 with the increase in development activity at the MEXGOL and SV fields resulting in the successes of the MEX109 well which came on production in June 2017 and the SV2 well which came on production in August 2017 providing a significant boost to production rates. During the year the Group continued its work on the subsurface of the MEXGOL and SV fields utilising the results of P .D.F. Limiteds comprehensive reevaluation study to plan additional development of these fields. This work included detailed reprocessing of the existing 3D seismic data using the latest processing technology with the reprocessed data now under interpretation. As well as the drilling of the MEX109 well and the workover of the SV2 well the Group undertook workover operations on the GOL2 and SV6 wells during the year to eliminate water ingress into the wells but these operations were not successful and the Group is currently considering further remedial work on these wells. The Group also installed additional compression equipment upgraded the gas processing facilities and pipeline network and undertook remedial work on existing wells. At the VAS field planning took place for the acquisition of new 3D seismic over the field and the drilling of the VAS10 well both of which activities commenced in early 2018. Health Safety Environment and Security HSES The Group is committed to maintaining the highest HSES standards and the effective management of these areas is an intrinsic element of the overall business ethos. Through strict enforcement of the Groups HSES Management System together with regular management meetings training and the appointment of dedicated safety professionals the Group strives to ensure that the impact of its business activities on its staff contractors and the environment is as low as is reasonably practicable. The Group reports safety and environmental performance in accordance with industry practice and guidelines. I am pleased to report that during 2017 a total of 448618 manhours of staff and contractor time were recorded without a Lost Time Incident occurring. The total number of safe man hours now stands at over 1444850 manhours without a Lost Time Incident. No environmental incidents were recorded during the year. Production Average daily production from the MEXGOL and SV fields over the year ended 31 December 2017 was 197961 md of gas 47 md of condensate and 24 md of LPG 1629 boepd in aggregate 2016 157228 m 3 d of gas 41 m 3 d of condensate and 19 md of LPG 1321 boepd in aggregate. Production rates improved significantly following the commencement of production from the MEX109 well in June 2017 and the SV2 well in August 2017. Average daily production from the VAS field for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 86242 m 3 d of gas and 6.5 m 3 d of condensate 608 boepd in aggregate Period from 4 July 2016 to 31 December 2016 82624 m 3 d of gas and 6.5 m 3 d of condensate 556 boepd in aggregate contributing material volumes to the Groups production output. The Groups average daily production for the period from 1 January 2018 to 28 March 2018 from the MEXGOL and SV field was 272656 md of gas 53 md of condensate and 32 md of LPG 2169 boepd in aggregate and from the VAS field was 86214 md of gas and 6.2 md of condensate 606 boepd in aggregate. Operations The improving geopolitical situation in Ukraine coupled with the stabilisation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia higher hydrocarbon prices and improvements in the fiscal and economic situation over the last year meant that the Group was able to increase the development programmes at its Ukrainian fields during 2017. At the MEXGOL and SV fields the Group continued to work with P .D.F. Limited to utilise its reevaluation study of these fields which involved analysis of all available geological geophysical petroleum engineering and well performance data. The continuing work included detailed reprocessing of existing 3D seismic data using the latest processing technology to try to improve the definition in such data. Interpretation of this new dataset is under way with the intention of utilising it to refine the new geological subsurface model of the fields. This work undertaken in conjunction with P .D.F. Limited will enable the Group to refine its strategies for the further development of the fields including the timing and level of future capital investment required to exploit the hydrocarbon resources. www.regalpetroleum.com 03 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Regal Petroluem AR2017.indd 3 08052018 163804 26054.02 8 May 2018 257 PM Proof 5 The MEX109 well which was spudded in July 2016 targeted the Visean reservoirs BSands in the MEXGOL field. The well was drilled to a depth of 4873 metres and completed in the B20 Visean reservoir. It was brought on production in June 2017. The initial production rates were very encouraging and the well has been producing consistently in excess of 90000 m 3 d since then. In early 2017 the Group entered into an agreement with NJSC Ukrnafta the majority Stateowned oil and gas producer in relation to the SV2 well which is a suspended well owned by NJSC Ukrnafta located within the Groups SV licence area.

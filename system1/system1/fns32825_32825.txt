Business review Page 60 09 Glencore Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Our market drivers We are dependent upon the supply of and demand for our commodities Key market drivers Impact on our industry Future commodity supply The procyclical nature of mining investment means that new mines are usually approved when commodity prices are higher Given the long development time frames required to bring new mine supply on line the timing as to when this appears in the economic cycle is difficult to predict and could appear at low points in the economic cycle creating excess supply in the market Overinvestment creates oversupply and with it a prolonged period of low commodity prices Although commodity prices have increased significantly from the lows seen in early 2016 the experience of the last economic cycle has provided investor pressure on companies to be more cautious about investing in new supply Balancing a finite declining resource base with the need to grow to meet expected future demand is an inherent challenge for companies in the resource sector Demand for the commodities we produce The industrialisation and urbanisation of developing economies over the last decade has driven significant growth in commodity demand Chinas rapid growth over this period now means that it accounts for up to half of global demand for most commodities As developing economies mature the commodities that drive their growth change Increased levels of industrialisation and urbanisation suggest demand growth rates for commodities may be lower in the future Negative demand could generate excess supply along with lower commodity prices Earlycycle commodities such as iron ore coking coal and cement may become less important as demand patterns shift in favour of mid and late cycle commodities such as copper zinc cobalt nickel thermal coal and agricultural products Energy and emissions transformation Momentum to decarbonise the global economy is gathering pace as nations increasingly coordinate efforts aimed at minimising emissions of carbon dioxide to achieve climate change goals and transition the world to a lowcarbon economy This transition is likely to increase the cost for fossil fuels impose levies for emissions and increase costs for monitoring and reporting and to reduce demand for fossil fuels Third parties including potential or actual investors may also introduce policies adverse to Glencore due to our interest in fossil fuels particularly coal Technological advances are making renewable energy sources more competitive with fossil fuels and are likely to displace them over the longer run.

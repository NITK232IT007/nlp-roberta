There are a number of ongoing secular drivers for the market which give us confidence in its sustained longterm growth. On the other hand we have seen a rise in competition from new business models which provide customers with increased choice and alternative ways to order delivered food. In the short term our franchisees are also experiencing cost pressures from inflation in labour and food. Finally the broader economic environment is also putting pressure on customers spending power. Each of these factors is analysed in more detail below. In summary our scale brand and operational excellence continue to confer a significant competitive advantage. The focus of the analysis is the UK market as that represents the vast majority of our revenue and profitability but we see similar longterm trends for delivered food in our other markets. UK delivered food market The UK delivered food market is worth 6.2 billion and was estimated to grow at 11 in 20162017 and grew at a compound rate of 14 between 2014 and 2016. The main drivers of this growth have been technology convenience and choice. In our annual survey among the nearly 40 of respondents who were ordering delivered food more often 40 cited ease of ordering 33 said it was more convenient than going out 24 liked the wider variety of options available 24 admitted to having less time to cook at home According to the survey this growth is migrating in broadly equal measure from cooking in and ready meals on the one hand and dining out and takeaways on the other. We anticipate all of these trends to continue leading to further growth in the market. One additional factor in the strength of the delivered food market is the rise in home entertainment big screen televisions catchup TV streaming services and interactive gaming have all increased the number of occasions when households order in. Pizza delivery Pizza is the single biggest cuisine within the delivered food market accounting for 2.1bn of sales including preorder carryout or collection sales.

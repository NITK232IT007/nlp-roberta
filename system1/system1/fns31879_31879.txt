Preston Grange is a BfL Outstanding development of three four and five bed homes in Preston village near Canterbury. Securing the best land We continue to see high quality land opportunities that exceed our required hurdle rates of a gross margin of 20 and a site ROCE of 25. Our success in buying land is based on the extensive local knowledge of our divisional land teams and strong local relationships with landowners combined with detailed assessments of local market conditions. We target locations based on the availability of land housing market conditions and the likelihood of obtaining planning consent. We continue to target a regionally balanced land portfolio with a supply of owned land of c. 3.5 years and a further c. 1.0 year of controlled land. Our target is for a shorter than sector average land bank reflecting our focus on ROCE and a fast build and sell model. At 30 June 2017 we achieved this target with a 4.5 year land supply excluding JVs comprising 3.5 years owned land and 1.0 years controlled land with the owned land bank including land with both outline and detailed planning consents.

As at 30 June 2017 95 30 June 2016 93 of our owned and controlled land is higher margin newer land. On the 306 sites that we have acquired and completed since 2009 we have achieved an average site gross margin of 20.8 and an average site ROCE of 35.7 demonstrating sustained delivery above our hurdle rates on this more recently acquired land. We maintained our progress in relation to strategic land where we see continued margin progression opportunities in the year. We approved the purchase of another 1568 strategic acres in FY17. The planning environment remains positive for strategic land. This together with the strong local relationships developed by our 24 divisions outside London mean we continue to see many high quality strategic opportunities. Whilst maintaining a first class operational land bank we remain focused on securing a longer term land pipeline through the acquisition of strategic land options. In the year 6757 plots 2016 4558 plots were transferred from strategic land to our owned land bank and 25 of our completions 2016 22 during the year were on strategically sourced land meeting our target. We use land creditors to defer payments for land acquisitions where appropriate to drive a higher ROCE and as at 30 June 2017 the land creditor position totalled 1064.0m 30 June 2016 1086.8m representing 37 30 June 2016 38 of the owned land bank. We are targeting land creditors at 30 to 35 of the owned land bank for June 2018.

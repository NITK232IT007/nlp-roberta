Domestic revenue was 7.6 below last year reflecting reduced activity levels in the market following the EU referendum with softness in both trade and retail. This was offset by significant growth in export revenue as the local sales operation established in Dubai in the previous year began to gain momentum with an encouraging pipeline of projects in place for the coming year. More recently the business has secured significant contract wins to supply Wickes and the NMBS buying group and has grown its relationship with Travis Perkins such that several new products will be rolled out across its extensive branch network. To meet this growth in volume we have started to expand the production facility in the UK which will be completed in the first half of the next financial year. Our product development work has focused on developing a moisture suppressant Pro DPM which can be used to control the rate of moisture released from a surface to enable the fast track installation of floor coverings and a new range of tile backer boards Pro Ply that are magnesium oxide based and will complement our existing Pro Board range of cementitious boards. The Pro DPM will be a component part of Pro Gypbase a product to be launched in the first quarter of the next financial year which will meet a clear need in the market for a fast track method to allow tiling onto gypsum based screeds within seven days. Underlying operating profit performance was marginally below last year reflecting the lower revenue and the continued investment in developing our new product programmes and increasing sales presence. 16 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 South Africa business review Business wide progress has led to a considerable increase in the return on sales to 7.2 2016 5.6.

Johnson Tiles South Africa Johnson Tiles South Africa our tile manufacturing business in South Africa continues to operate at maximum manufacturing capacity. As a consequence of the growth in demand from Tile Africa supply to the independent market was constrained with external revenues of 10.8m 1.8 lower than last year on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis revenue was 10.2 ahead of the 9.8m achieved in the prior year. The launch of new manufactured and factored ranges such as the Johnson White Collection together with sales of higher value large format tiles and coupled with further operational plant improvements resulted in an underlying operating profit ahead of last year with excellent cash conversion. Another year of strong constant currency growth.

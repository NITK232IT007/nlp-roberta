Several larger projects were secured. The ASIC version of VRS which is being sold on the basis of OEM agreement for use in document scanners is being sold to both new scanner manufacturers and for new scanner models thereby increasing its future sales prospects significantly. In May 2002 we were awarded an US patent for VRS. Ascent Capture 5.5 a major release of the award winning capture application was launched in May 2002 offering broader product functionality and improved support for high performance databases. With these improvements Ascent Capture has been able to gain further market share in the high end sector of the EDC market. In June 2002 we launched Ascent Ricochet. It is the first software product on the market that extends professional EDC features to every desktop in an enterprise government organisation or not for profit organisation. It permits Multifunctional Products and digital copiers to be used as document scanners. Almost all organisations have copiers and scanner in use. This new product brings added efficiency and features to these equipment investments.

Additionally the Group changed its accounting of direct costs for its increased income from professional services. While those costs have been included under operating expenses in previous periods the board considered that it should be shown as direct costs of sales as from this year on. Thus the accounting change has only an impact on Gross profit and Operating expenses while Operating Profit remains unchanged.

Sales rental growth and profitability The key strengths of our operating business are our people our PRISM operating platform our brand and the strength of our relationships with Universities. We have continued to build on these throughout 2017 resulting in a 12 increase in EPRA earnings to 70.5 million 2016 62.7 million. This growth has again been driven by high occupancy rental growth and the impact of portfolio movements as well as further operational efficiencies and ongoing cost discipline.

An increase in net debt of 27 million to 803 million 2016 776 million was offset by a lower average cost of finance of 4.1 2016 4.2 as we have added new debt facilities at lower average rates taking advantage of the historically low cost of debt. The increase in net debt was driven largely by spend on development activities which has in turn led to an increase to 7 .4 million in the amount of interest that is capitalised into development schemes up from 5.9 million in 2016. We expect the level of interest capitalisation to remain at around this level given the ongoing level of development activity in 2018 and 2019. Development precontract and other costs fell to 4.6 million 2015 5.5 million reflecting the levels of site acquisition the earnings impact of sharebased incentives and our contribution to our charitable trust the Unite Foundation. Occupancy reservations and rental growth Occupancy across Unites portfolio for the 201718 academic year stands at 99 and likeforlike rental growth of 3.4 was achieved on our portfolio. We have continued to grow the proportion of beds let to Universities with 60 of rooms under nominations agreements 201617 58 up by 5000 beds over the last three years. Enhanced service levels and our extensive understanding of student needs have resulted in longerterm and more robust partnerships with Universities. Rental income has increased by 1 1.7 million up 7 as a result of new openings and sustained rental growth after the impact of disposals made in the year. NOI margin improved to 74.1 December 2016 73.1 reflecting further operating efficiencies from the PRISM operating platform. PRISM provides us with the ability to differentiate ourselves from other operators driving efficiencies through the use of technology which also provides enhanced levels of service for our customers. We maintain our expectation that NOI margins will improve to 75 in 2018 whilst ensuring that we remain focused on service level enhancements. In 2017 we implemented an efficiency programme which will deliver 5 million of savings Unite share 3.8 million. These savings were driven by streamlined processes and procedures as a result of our student insight PRISM and the scale of the business and will reduce the 24.6 million of operating costs incurred during 2017. These savings mean that we are on track to deliver our overhead efficiency target in 2018. Recurring management fee income from joint ventures remained at 14.1 million 2016 14.0 million as a result of the valuation growth of assets under management in USAF and LSAV offset by disposal activity. In addition to the recurring asset management fees a further 4.3 million of net performance and acquisition fees were generated from USAF and LSAV 2016 6.9 million. The USAF net performance fee is based on USAFs cumulative total return at 31 December 2017 and is payable in USAF units.

Head Office costs fell by 22 compared to 2016.

A strong and healthy culture is central to our success. Evidence of the importance of a strong culture was on full display during parts of the third and fourth quarter of 2017 as our US team handled disruption caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma with determination and professionalism caring for customers and working seamlessly with suppliers who were impacted by the storms. We are proud of their efforts every day. 07 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategic Report Looking ahead We have an attractive opportunity to achieve significant profitable growth by expanding our presence in markets that remain fragmented and largely addressable through our direct marketing model. The continued evolution and diversification of our marketing portfolio should allow us to drive further sustained revenue growth much in the same way that the addition of online activities complemented our catalogue marketing activities many years ago. The second half of 2017 saw our first investment into testing elements of a new component to our marketing strategy designed to increase the overall awareness of the 4imprint brand amongst our target audience. This relatively small initial investment was aimed at providing important insights to help inform the direction of a broader evolution of our strategy that we will begin to implement in 2018. We expect the careful cultivation and development of this brand awareness component of our marketing portfolio to be a complementary driver of future growth in 2018 and beyond. We will employ a combination of different marketing techniques including traditional broadcast media and the expansion of our advertising presence in digital media. A budget of around 7m has been allocated to this project in 2018. This new initiative will represent incremental investment it will not be funded through reallocation of resources away from our existing proven marketing engine which continues to be an effective growth generator. Therefore we anticipate an investment phase during 2018 as we apply our familiar and proven test read adjust approach to rolling out this new component of our strategy. As a result we expect that 2018 operating profit is likely to be flat against 2017 reflecting the longer investment period that this type of marketing typically requires. This is an evolution of our previous financial strategy of organic revenue growth subject to maintaining broadly constant operating margin percentage it does not represent a wholesale change in direction or philosophy. Rather it is a measured investment back into the business to diversify our marketing programme in a way that fundamentally strengthens the business for the future. We fully expect profitability to remain healthy and the business to remain highly cash generative as the benefits are felt over the next several years. As a measure of our confidence in the Groups growth strategy we have set a new target of reaching 1bn of revenue by 2022. 2018 will be an exciting year for the Group as we evolve our established and effective marketing platform in pursuit of our strategic objective of market leadership driving organic growth.

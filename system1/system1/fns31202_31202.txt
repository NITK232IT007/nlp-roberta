Investing in people Throughout the year we have continued to strengthen our business unit leadership. We have appointed new leaders in a number of our business units Canada Middle East North East Europe Case and Brazil. We also launched our global Project Manager Academy. The Academy will take our younger project managers to the next level in their careers focusing on people commercial and technical leadership skills. We continued to make progress in our safety accident frequency rate AFR performance with another significant decline in the frequency rate from 0.34 in 2016 to 0.23 in 2017. We have cut our AFR by around 80 since the introduction of our Think Safe programme in 2013. We received many safety accolades from customers around the world with one of our Australian business units winning the Rio Tinto worldwide safety award. However we take nothing for granted in this domain sadly illustrated by the tragic road traffic accident in South Africa where 18 of our colleagues lost their lives. We thank our whole community in South Africa for the support and humanity they showed to all the bereaved and their relatives in the difficult time last summer. 15 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview An example of leveraging scale and expertise the Polavaram Dam project used our jet grouting capability which brought subject matter experts and equipment from Europe and the US to India. Chief Executive Officers review continued 2020 benefits target We said in our 2016 preliminary results announcement that we expected to realise 50m of annualised total gross benefits from the groups strategic initiatives by 2020 around half of which was expected to be reflected as improved profitability. We broke this down as 20m to come from procurement 20m from operational improvements and 10m from growth. Progress against this target at the end of 2017 is set out below Gross benefits m 2020 target Progress to date Procurement 20.0 11.3 Operational improvements 20.0 1.3 Growth 10.0 4.6 50.0 17.2 In the first year of a fouryear programme we have achieved around onethird of the targeted gross benefits. We estimate that between 5m and 7m of the benefits realised to date have directly impacted profit and are sustainable. Of the rest either their sustainability is as yet unproven or they have been leveraged to win more work or offset by incremental investment in strategic initiatives. Meaningful procurement savings have been achieved from national and regional agreements on categories as diverse as equipment rental IT haulage sparesconsumables and lodging. The benefits from Operational improvements to date mainly relate to equipment management and maintenance as the programme to introduce lean techniques to project sites is in its infancy. Benefits under growth include both those from new offices and from a more structured approach to the transfer of technology. Summary Overall Keller has had a positive year with good growth in group revenue and profits. The results were extremely strong in EMEA and solid in North America but disappointing in APAC. Ongoing operational improvements strengthened leadership and market recovery should lead to APAC returning to profitability in 2018. Our confidence in group fundamentals and the recent US tax changes have allowed us to significantly raise the dividend to shareholders. The order book of over 1bn gives us confidence as we start 2018. Most of our markets remain robust and bidding activity is at a healthy level. Overall despite the completion of our excellent Caspian project we expect 2018 to be another year of underlying progress.

Themed Delivering excellence the event combined presentations from the Board Executive Committee customers and consultants. Discussion sessions shared best practice projects improvement initiatives and business unit performance. Delegates also had the chance to visit the local Keller branches of Suncoast Hayward Baker and Bencor. But perhaps the biggest benefit of all was the ability to network with colleagues from around the globe and discuss how we can continue to deliver excellence today whilst driving growth and improvements for the longer term. 17 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Results summary KPIs 2016 2017 968.7 952.9 Revenue m 968.7m 2 2016 2017 18.8 21.1 Return on net operating assets 18.8 2016 2017 78.7 86.9 Underlying operating prot m 78.7m 9 2016 2017 0.07 0.12 Accident frequency rate 0.07 2016 2017 8.1 9.1 Underlying operating margin 8.1 2016 2017 8.5 6 Sta turnover 8.5 Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of average net operating assets including goodwill acquired through acquisitions.

In North America which accounts for around half the groups revenue reported revenue increased by 2 although constant currency revenue was down 4. Underlying operating profit was 78.7m down 14 on a constant currency basis and the underlying operating margin decreased from 9.1 to 8.1. After first half 2017 constant currency revenue decreased 10 yearonyear the division returned to yearonyear revenue growth in the second half. Whilst the second half profitability was lower than in 2016 this was largely due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter which together had an estimated negative oneoff profit impact of 3m. Looking forward the yearend North American order book of work to be undertaken over the next 12 months was 5 above last year. This together with the improving trend in underlying trading gives us confidence for 2018.

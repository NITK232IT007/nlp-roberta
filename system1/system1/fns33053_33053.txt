Operating profit before impairments Operating profit before impairments was 488.8m 423.4m an increase of 65.4m or 15.4. This consists of the operating profit before impairments for each of the six divisions as described in the operating review which totalled 520.3m 446.1m less central expenses of 31.5m 22.7m. The increase in central expenses of 8.8m includes 4.4m relating to a bodily injury claim in the USA which is selfinsured centrally by the company. Operating impairments Operating impairments in the period were 4.0m compared with 29.3m in the previous year. The net charge for the year consists of 23.6m of impairment charges offset by a reversal of 19.6m. The charges relate primarily to the US and UK aggregates divisions. The reversal follows an economic improvement in the supply arrangements at certain operations in the US aggregates division and additional disposal proceeds at certain UK aggregates sites. Exchange impact Foreign exchange translation increased group turnover by 35.2m operating profit before impairments by 6.4m and profit before tax by 6.0m. The US dollar year end exchange rate moved from 1.9199 at December 31 2004 to 1.71 68 at December 31 2005. The net impact of foreign exchange movements resulted in an increase in sterling translated net debt from December 31 2004 to December 31 2005 of 95.7m.

Interest payable on loans totalled 1 19.0m 92.2m against interest receivable of 60.1m 40.0m resulting in a net interest cost of 58.9m 52.2m. The main reason for the increase in the net interest charge was an increased level of net debt following the acquisitions made in 2005. Interest cost on the pension plan liabilities and other postretirement benefits was 1 03.2m 99.2m offset by an expected return on pension assets of 1 08.7m 111.2m to give a net pension finance income of 5.5m 1 2. 0m. The reduction in income resulted primarily from a reduction in interest rates. The unwind of the discounting relating to longterm provisions was a charge of 2.5m 6.6m and included the impact of a change in discount rates. Taxation on continuing operations Taxation on continuing operations was 34.4m 27 .1m. The 2005 charge consisted of an underlying tax charge excluding the tax relating to jointventures and associates of 58.4m a net release from provisions of 29.6m and a charge of 5.6m relating to impairments. The 2004 tax charge has been restated by 49.6m following a change in the interpretation of the deferred tax accounting requirements under IFRS.

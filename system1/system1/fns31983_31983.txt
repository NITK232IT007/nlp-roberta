Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information 6 MJ Gleeson plc Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 A housing regeneration specialist working in challenging communities to provide new homes for sale to people on low incomes in the North of England. Gleeson Homes continues to build significant value for shareholders as well as delivering a unique social benefit in helping people on lower incomes move from housing poverty caused by the rent trap into home ownership and wealth creation. Our homes are affordable enough to be sold to a couple on the current national living wage and quite often mortgage repayments are less than comparable council house rents. Key features of the Gleeson Homes business model COMMUNITY REGENERATION Over the years Gleeson Homes has played a key role in regenerating challenging communities. Through establishing strong relationships with local authorities Gleeson Homes has created a virtuous circle in which it acquires and redevelops legacy sites where there is an obvious need for social and economic regeneration and builds homes at affordable prices thus enabling home ownership. This virtuous circle will continue to underpin the business and allows for future geographic expansion. SUCCESSFUL LAND PURCHASE We partner with local authorities and private land owners to acquire land in socially and economically deprived areas which will benefit from community regeneration. We have a very carefully targeted land buying strategy that has clearly defined and challenging hurdle rates. DRIVING DOWN BUILDING COSTS We build traditional two three and four bedroom detached and semidetached homes. We ensure that our good quality homes are built to the specification that our customers desire. LOW OVERHEADS We ensure that overhead costs are kept low by having small and similarly structured management teams in each operating area and by continuously measuring their relative performance. ENABLING THE CUSTOMER We offer our customers a range of bespoke financial packages including a deposit saving scheme to enable them to become homeowners. 6 MJ Gleeson plc Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017 Gleeson Homes Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Further Information Gleeson Homes builds low cost homes for people on low incomes in areas of industrial decline and social and economic deprivation.

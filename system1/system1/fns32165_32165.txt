This means that our overall spreads market share has climbed by 2 percentage points to 27.2. With Clover we continued to reinforce the no artificial ingredients positioning through a marketing campaign in the first half of the year and launched new packaging in the second half of the year. We were pleased that the no artificial ingredients recipe received external recognition as Product of the Year 2017 in the spreads category in the worlds largest consumer survey award for product innovation. Whilst Country Life overall volumes were flat for the year sales were up 2. Country Life spreadable which accounts for 65 of brand sales grew volumes by 6 and was the best performing major branded spreadable product over the year. However the block product experienced a volume decline as we promoted less following the sharp rises in input costs. Frylight another exceptional year Frylight our one calorie cooking spray has had another outstanding year. Volumes grew by 23 and sales by 19 well ahead of market growth of 1 and 2 respectively Kantar data for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2017. Frylight has strengthened its lead as the UKs number one oil brand and increased its share of the market for the whole year to 11 with a household penetration rate of 23. Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 11 Strategic report GROWING Innovation continues to drive our business forward. As well as building on the success of the new Clover product in the year ended 31 March 2017 we brought a new Frylight product to market avocado spray oil developed a new Frylight cap design to be launched in early 201718 launched a new Cathedral City snack bar range relaunched the Cathedral City spreadable range strengthened our dairy free Vitalite range with the launch of a new coconut variant and agreed a partnership with Fowler Welch Coolchain Ltd a logistics specialist to maximise the throughput at our Nuneaton distribution and warehousing site. A simpler business Dairy Crest is a simple lean and responsive business. We have five wellinvested manufacturing sites and fewer than 1200 employees. There are opportunities to further simplify procedures and support structures within the business. During the year we embarked on a change to our core IT systems which will bring benefits over the next two years. This will deliver a more appropriate and cost effective IT infrastructure for a business of our scale and is also acting as a catalyst for us to simplify the processes that sit alongside these IT systems. We continue to drive operational efficiency improvements. A particular focus is improving performance efficiency at Kirkby where we successfully consolidated all our butters and spreads production onto one site in 2015. We are confident that all our sites will contribute towards further improved productivity over the year to 31 March 2018. Future prospects In the first full year since the transformational sale of our Dairies business we have delivered a robust performance in a tough market. Our industry leading margins are the result of us driving long term value through innovation brand building investment in a world class supply chain and strong cost control. Our key brands continue to perform well. Cathedral City remains the nations favourite cheese and following its brand refresh at the start of the year the good progress and momentum we have seen in the last six months has continued in the new financial year. Our overall spreads market share has climbed and Frylight had another outstanding year with sales growing 19 well ahead of the market. The ongoing investment we are putting behind our brands gives me confidence that we can grow market share. We have continued to make good progress in our demineralised whey operations at Davidstow. We are now hitting our targeted level of demineralised whey being of infant formula grade. Developing our sales of demineralised whey and GOS into the highmargin global infant formula market will be a key priority this year. At the same time we are continuing our research into other potential animal and human applications for GOS. Looking forward I am excited about the future for Dairy Crest. The business is well positioned to deliver profitable sustainable growth and stronger cash generation underpinning our commitment to growing our dividends and reducing debt. mark Allen Chief Executive 17 May 2017 12 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2017 FinAnCiAl reVieW Product group prot m 68.3m 13 14 15 16 17 Cash generated from used in operations m 32.8m 33.1 25.5 58.6 39.3 16.8 56.1 36.4 29.6 66.0 42.8 25.5 68.3 33.1 33.8 66.9 Prot on continuing operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles Butters spreads oils Cheese functional ingredients 13 14 15 16 17 19.1 13.8 35.3 31.3 32.8 overview This year we have delivered a set of results which demonstrate the underlying robustness of our business. Revenue is lower than last year despite flat volumes reflecting the deflationary environment that existed for much of the last two years. However milk and butter input costs rose significantly as the year progressed. Despite this highly volatile background we improved profit margins.

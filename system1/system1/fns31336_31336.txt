The millennial generation in particular are perpetuating this trend as games now cater to a much wider variety of interests. This has clearly been proven in recent years as revenues in the global games market have surpassed the 100 billion mark Source NewZoo Global Games Market Report June 2017. Data suggests this wont be stopping any time soon with revenues set to reach almost 130 billion by 2020 representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of around 6. Mobile continues to lead the charge with smartphones accounting for 32 of global revenue in 2017 and representing the largest single category contributor and the fastest growing endmarket in gaming. Goldman Sachs anticipates this could reach 40 by 2021 Source Entering the halcyon days of Gamings digital age Goldman Sachs Investment Research September 2017. Games companies are no longer simply producing games and increasingly are turning game IP into entertainment franchises which has forced them to rethink their position in the broader entertainment industry which in turn increases demand to engage outsourced service providers such as Keywords. Keywords operates in an exciting high growth market without the risk of exposure to the successes or failures of individual game titles.

Increasingly customers are looking to outsource multiple services to providers who can offer all of these under one umbrella by way of strategic partnerships as well as exploring more codevelopment in which significant parts of or even full games are developed on behalf of game developers or game publishers. This trend shift makes groups with a diverse and broad offering very attractive particularly to smaller service providers looking to become part of a larger organisation. According to Goldman Sachs an MA cycle should benefit the scale players such as Keywords. With rising barriers to entry across the sector they expect to see consolidation in the sector as larger firms use growing cash balances to acquire highquality smaller companies particularly in the mobile sector the largest and fastestgrowing gaming market Source Goldman Sachs September 2017. 10 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC Strategic Report Profitable and synergistic growth Good progress being made in becoming a strategic partner to major games companies.

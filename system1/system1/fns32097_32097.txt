Andrew Page Chairman REVIEW 03 REVIEW 02 25361.02 13617 Proof Four QA WITH THE CEO Kevin Bradshaw What are the three key things you have learned in your first five months with Northgate KB My first impressions on joining are that Northgate is a fundamentally good well positioned business with great people that have a real desire to serve our customers well and in turn deliver strong returns for our shareholders There is however work to be done and I am excited by the challenges that lie ahead. What is your vision for the Group over the medium term KB Over the first five months I have managed to spend time across our network with people working in all areas of the business. I believe that the potential for Northgate is very significant and that we are a business that is capable of delivering good long term growth in cash flows with returns well ahead of our cost of capital. The strategic review on pages 6 to 39 highlights four key growth priorities to deliver these returns. The first area that needs attention is of course the UK business and I have already started to address this with selfhelp actions and leadership changes. What have been the reasons for the reduction in vehicles on hire in the UK KB Competition has certainly intensified but our market research concludes that the rental market has grown by c.6 a year over the last three years. Reductions in vehicles on hire in our business have been broadbased across the range of customer sizes industry sectors and geography. Some critical key weaknesses have persisted in the execution of our sales and marketing efforts and I have put in measures to address these going forward. What are your key sustainability priorities over the medium term KB We constantly strive to reduce environmental impacts to ensure we are building a sustainable business. Over the medium term I will encourage further initiatives around energy usage and waste management to ensure we continue to progress.

Economic growth will drive demand and on the other hand our flexible product lends itself well to periods of uncertainty. Under any scenario the Group has a secure funding base and robust balance sheet which underpins our confidence for the future.

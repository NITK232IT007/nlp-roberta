Financial results for each division are presented in note 2 Operating segments. Underlying operating profit in the PI division reduced in 2017 by 21.8 to 11.0m 2016 14.1m as we invested in the working capital required to fund cases through our two new ABS businesses. These joint operations with two of our PLFs will deliver profit as their cases begin to settle. Critical Care had a good year and increased underlying operating profit by 2.5 to 3.9m 2016 3.8m. Residential Property delivered a creditable performance delivering 1.4m of underlying operating profit 2016 1.4m at an expanded margin. Underlying revenue increased by 3.3 to 51.0m. This was mainly a result of the relaunch of the National Accident Helpline brand during the year and we experienced an increase in leads generated yearonyear. PI underlying revenue increased by 5.5 to 31.7m 2016 30.0m. Our CC division experienced 6.6 growth in revenue to 11.0m 2016 10.4m and the future outlook for this business is encouraging. 23 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Governance Strategic report Residential Property revenues contracted by 7.5 to 8.3m 2016 9.0m in a subdued residential property market that continues to lack sales momentum. The management team is focused on growing market share through optimising our operations and developing a number of business to business B2B initiatives. After allowing for sharebased payments amortisation of intangible assets acquired on business combinations exceptional costs and financial income and expense the Group returned a profit before tax of 12.4m a 21.4 decrease on 2016 2016 15.8m. Exceptional items The Group incurred 0.4m of exceptional costs during the year 2016 a 0.6m exceptional credit. This comprises 1.2m 2016 0.5m of costs associated with the National Accident Helpline brand relaunch and a 0.8m credit relating to releases from the preLASPO ATE liability and associated costs 2016 1.2m. Taxation The Groups tax charge of 2.5m 2016 3.6m represents an effective tax rate of 19.9 2016 22.6. Earnings per share EPS and dividend Basic EPS is calculated on the total profit of the Group and most closely relates to the ongoing cash which will be attributable to shareholders and in turn the Groups ability to fund its dividend programme. The Group also has a number of share options outstanding see note 21 of the financial statements which resulted in a Diluted EPS. Basic EPS for the year was 21.7p 2016 27.0p and Diluted EPS was 21.6p 2016 26.5p which was ahead of the Boards expectation due to the lower level of exceptional costs and a better than expected level of net debt during the year. Subject to approval at the AGM on 23 May 2018 the Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.60p 2016 12.70p which when added to the interim dividend of 5.30p 2016 6.35p gives a total dividend of 15.90p. This is a decrease of 16.5 on last year. For 2018 the Board intends to amend its dividend policy to 2.0x cover of retained earnings which it will review again in 2020 once our third ABS is fully established. We believe this to be a prudent solution to funding our new strategy whilst also maintaining sufficient flexibility within our debt facility at a relatively low leverage.

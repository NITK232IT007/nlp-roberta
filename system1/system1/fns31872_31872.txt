Fortunately the last five years have seen HSJ transformed into a highly successful digital intelligence service an achievement which resulted in it being named the best B2B media brand in two out of the last three years. HSJs success can be attributed to a number of different factors. Firstly its focus on digital delivery and engagement across a range of platforms. The weekly print magazine has been slowly phased out July 2017 saw its last edition printed. Secondly development of a range of new services most notably the strategic targeting and insight tool along with the best practice database HSJ Solutions has enabled HSJ it to serve the evolving needs of the healthcare suppliers. Each of these services won major industry launch awards in both 2015 and 2017. Additionally leaving behind its legacy of targeting individual subscribers HSJ is now focusing on organisational deals with NHS trusts and the suppliers who trade with them all along demonstrating unwavering commitment to excellence in editorial sales and marketing. An interesting fact is that the HSJ content team led by Editor Alastair McLellan contains twice as many expert healthcare correspondents as employed by the BBC. The sales team led by the Commercial Director Will Johnston with a mix of specialist new business leads senior account managers and customer relationship executives has powered the growth in HSJs revenues increasing subscription revenue by over 60 during the last three years. The marketing team led by Marketing Director Dan Gorringe has been responsible for migrating subscribers from print to digital with the minimum impact on revenues and reach.

We also continued to invest in our leadership development programmes and apprenticeship schemes. Outlook The year ahead brings challenges in the form of further cost headwinds particularly from a full years impact in the fall in Sterling and uncertainty around consumer spending but we approach these from a position of strength. We hold leading positions in fragmented markets have detailed plans and initiatives to mitigate cost headwinds and our growing service and services propositions set us apart as a specialist retailer. It was disappointing that earlier this month our CEO Jill McDonald tendered her resignation to take up a senior role at MS at the end of October. We are grateful for the positive contribution she has made across the business and she will leave Halfords with a clear direction to drive future growth. The Moving Up A Gear strategy is well underway and is delivering significant momentum across the organisation. Crucially we have a talented group of engaged colleagues who remain focused on implementing our strategy and providing customers with the very best customer service in doing so we will drive sustainable longterm growth.

Gross margin of 51.0 was 220 basis points lower than the prior year predominantly due to the impact of the movement in foreign currency exchange rates. T otal operating costs before non recurring items rose by 5.0 reflecting planned investments for the Moving Up A Gear strategy and the firsttime inclusion of the operating expenditure in respect of the acquired Tredz and Wheelies businesses. The increase in cost of goods associated with the depreciation in Sterling had an adverse impact of circa 14m premitigation which more than accounted for the decline in profit for the year. Underlying EBITDA was down 5.1 to 108.7m. Underlying EBIT was 77.1m which compares with 84.5m in the prior year. Underlying Profit Before Tax was 75.4m and Underlying Basic Earnings Per Share was 30.3p down 7.5 and 8.7 respectively. Profit after tax for the year was 56.4m FY16 63.5m.

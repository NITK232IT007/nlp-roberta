We set out to maximise functionality and connectivity in a single comprehensive system comprising rugged and reliable hardware connectivity with other technologies and meaningful realtime output. The control unit is mounted in each truck and transmits live data across various protocols to iTrack servers at one of three global control centres. Dedicated iTrack experts are on hand to analyse live and historic data determine trends and create custom reports and warnings. Mine operations will have access to tyre temperature pressure sensor function GPS and speed data on easy to read customisable screens. This data can provide invaluable signals not only to avoid tyre failures and increase life but also to increase truck speeds availability and productivity. Our offer provides the equipment on finance or operating lease although our preference will be towards operating leases with additional charges for data provision and monitoring. Transense Technologies plc Annual report and financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 9 Chief Executives report continued The market response to launch has been very encouraging and we have subsequently generated live trials on 14 sites covering 3 continentsterritories. Trials have generally been successful and whilst the rate of adoption meets our high expectations the trial duration and lead times to roll out and revenue generation are often extended by understandable bureaucratic and operational delays. Probe During the year several multinational tyre manufacturers have commenced the implementation of new software platforms that have been integrated with the probe and it has become clear that our product is the tread depth tool of choice for Bridgestone Goodyear and Continental amongst others and as a result our probe revenue in the final quarter of the year experienced a marked upturn. In addition to this we have since the year end received our first significant order for our PCAS from Tiger Wheel in South Africa. PCAS is a software system coupled with our tread depth probe which enables a tyre fitter to complete a fast accurate tread depth audit of a passenger car and produce a customer friendly report which acts as a visual aid for the garage to sell tyres and additional services such as alignments. We are hopeful this initial order will lead to further sales in South Africa and elsewhere. Current trading and outlook Since the beginning of the new financial year on 1 July 2017 revenues have shown a significant increase on the run rate of the prior year. iTrack II was adopted by two Glencore mines in Australia during June 2017 and in early August 2017 a further Australian mine operated by BHP. These systems are now in implementation and revenues have commenced. Several other opportunities are at a reasonably advanced stage and we expect further order activity in Australia Latin America and Southern Africa in coming weeks. Furthermore as indicated above order intake for probes has started to build momentum and has already reached a level comparable with nearly 60 of the aggregate order intake for last year. We continue to engage with GE and others on commercialisation of SAW projects in a variety of applications although we do not anticipate strong growth in revenues in this area in the short term. Accordingly we consider that the outlook for the next financial year is satisfactory. Graham Storey Chief Executive 25 September 2017 Transense Technologies plc Annual report and financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2017 10 Strategic Report Financial Review Results for the year Revenues from continuing activities totaled 2.00m 2016 5.12m and after excluding the IntelliSAW license fee resulting in revenue of 2.08m. The pretax loss before discontinued operations totalled 2.16m 2016 profit 1.60m which included the license fee of 3.04m before costs and 2.76m after costs and an adjusted loss of 1.16m before the net license fee. Translogik revenues fell by 27 to 1.19m and SAWSense generated 0.81m of revenues including the GE license fees of 0.58m from the design development and low volume production activities 2016 0.45m excluding the IntelliSAW license fee of 3.04m. Gross margins were 57 2016 64 excluding the IntelliSAW license fee reflecting the change in the mix between business activities. Administrative overheads for the year amounted to 3.32m compared with 2.54m in the prior year. The fall in Translogik revenues reflected the slow down in sales during the period of upgrading iTrack from the original version to iTrack II IT2. IT2 was launched in September 2016 and the additional support costs including staffing overseas offices in South America Australia and Africa and marketing represented over 0.40m of the increased administrative costs. The other principal costs contributing to the increase were the provision for a potential bad debt of 0.09m one off professional costs 0.09m and a reduction in the forex gain of 0.08m. The Earnings per share EPS are set out below in Pence 2017 2016 EPS including discounted operations 22.84 18.05 EPS excluding discounted operations 22.78 12.90 The EPS numbers are calculated after rebasing the old 1p shares reflecting the 501 share reduction carried out in November 2016. Taxation The Company has UK tax losses available to carry forward at 30 June 2017 of approximately 18.7m subject to HMRC agreement. Certain elements of development expenditure undertaken by the Company are eligible for enhanced research and development tax relief which generally relates to salary costs of technical staff.

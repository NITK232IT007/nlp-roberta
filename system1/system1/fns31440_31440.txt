The detail of this evaluation is covered in the Governance Report. The Board visited the Teradek business in California US in October 2017 and met with the Creative Solutions senior management team including the founders of each of the constituent businesses of Teradek SmallHD Paralinx Wooden Camera and RTMotion. This was an exceptionally valuable exercise in building the Boards knowledge and understanding of the new division and the talent of the divisional team.

I am excited by the strength of our development pipeline and the promising opportunities that lie ahead for Telford Homes to play an increasing role in meeting the need for new homes in London. Andrew Wiseman Chairman 30 May 2017 THE PAVILIONS N1 I am delighted to be able to look back on another excellent year and on behalf of the Board I wish to thank all of our employees for their hard work in delivering these results.

The economic environment is proving to be robust and the economy has performed better than expected post the EU referendum vote with the housing market remaining resilient. Demand and population growth in London There has been consistent long term growth in Londons population see chart 2. This has led to ever growing demand for housing in the capital which has not been matched by the number of homes built. Over the past few years there has been a recovery in the housing market driven by wider economic recovery increased access to low cost mortgage financing improved availability of land through the planning process and Government support for the housing sector. These remain key drivers for the market over the longer term with the outlook strong in the near term. The immediate impact of the EU referendum in June 2016 was relatively shortlived with the widespread positive attitude adopted within the UK maintaining consumer and business confidence. However the medium term impact of the referendum as exit terms are negotiated is yet to be seen. With prices high in central boroughs the search for value and for higher price growth prospects in recent years has led to a surge in demand in Outer London locations. These characteristics are being sought by both owneroccupiers and investors and we expect this trend to escalate over the next five years.

Housing starts reduced in 2016 further exacerbating the situation. MARKET OVERVIEW DEVELOPING IN LONDON FAVOURABLE FUNDAMENTALS 08 Housing starts reduce There were circa 17000 new build starts in London for the year to June 2016 down from around 25000 in 2015 see chart 3. This was the lowest level since 2012 and intensifies the cumulative deficit built up over decades. Tax changes The move to a tiered system of Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT in recent years has assisted the majority of the Groups customers because Telford Homes typical price point is lower than the 925000 threshold where higher rates are now payable. However legislation introduced on 1 April 2016 increased by three per cent the SDLT payable by purchasers of buytolet or second homes. This has led to many UK based investors becoming more circumspect about new purchases although overseas buyers have been less deterred with the fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum undoubtedly a factor. Build to rent investors factor SDLT into their acquisition model prior to any offer to purchase being made. Changes have also been introduced to mortgage interest tax relief for investors. Prior to April 2017 landlords could deduct mortgage interest and other financerelated costs from their rental income before calculating their tax liability. This relief will be removed gradually between 2017 and 2020 although a tax credit worth 20 per cent of the mortgage interest cost will remain allowable. Increasing rental demand Affordability of housing in London is challenging. In 2016 seven of the ten least affordable local authority locations in the UK were in London. Unsurprisingly therefore the number of households renting homes in London has increased by 450000 in the last 10 years. The increase in average private rents in London relative to the rest of England is indicative of the demand for rented accommodation in the capital see chart 4. Government support The Housing White Paper published in February 2017 seeks to address some of the issues that have inhibited housing supply. Proposals including accelerating the planning process making available more development land and supporting SME builders in order to build sector capacity are encouraging. The planning regime has historically been a key constraint on the housebuilding industrys ability to provide the number of new homes needed to keep pace with demand. Approval rates have improved over the last few years since the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framework although the process to obtain planning permission and discharge conditions can remain arduous with the shortage of local authority planning officers a key factor.

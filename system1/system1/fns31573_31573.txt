Notes 1 CER is constant exchange rates Eurodenominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the reported results on a more comparable basis. 2 Likeforlike adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth Altrincham Birmingham including closure of our existing Birmingham store and Emerainville as well as Chiswick and CombslaVille and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has been adjusted. 3 The consideration paid for Alligator on 1 November 2017 was 56.0m and is subject to customary working capital adjustment. 4 Cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items corporate transaction costs change in fair value of derivatives gainloss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue excluding shares held by the Safestore Employee Benefit Trust. 5 Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the period after tax but excluding corporate transaction costs change in fair value of derivatives gainloss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of exceptional items IFRS 2 sharebased payment charges exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost is excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a noncash item with the exception of the associated National Insurance element. Therefore neither the Company s ability to distribute nor pay dividends are impacted with the exception of the associated National Insurance element.

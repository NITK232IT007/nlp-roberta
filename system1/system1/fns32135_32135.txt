Financial Review continued Pensions The defined benefit pension scheme deficit has increased by 14.4 million to 37.9 million 2016 23.5 million. The present value of pension obligations increased from 119.5 million to 149.3 million this was driven by the assumed discount rate decreasing from 3.55 to 2.60 RPI inflation assumptions increasing from 3.05 to 3.30 and a 3.2 million experience loss due to the updating of membership data following the 2016 triennial valuation. This was partly offset by an increase in the fair value of scheme assets of 15.4 million from 96.0 million to 111.4 million. Following the conclusion of the 2016 triennial valuation the Company agreed to increase the deficit recovery payments to 2.0 million per annum from 1 January 2017 from 1.1 million. Deficit recovery payments of 1.3 million were therefore made during the financial year. Shareholders return Adjusted earnings per share were 5 higher than last year at 61.39p 2016 58.35p.

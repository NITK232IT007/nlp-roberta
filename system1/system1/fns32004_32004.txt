To achieve this Inland Homes has drawn on its extensive experience within the senior management team to manage the challenges of site delivery to meet programme timetables and enable approvals that the Group can either take forward as future constructions sites or as land available for sale. The Group operates across a diverse land portfolio from town centre developments to major regeneration projects as well as some redevelopment of land located in the greenbelt. This requires land and planning teams with a unique skillset and expertise that sets us apart from our peers. Set out below some are of the projects that we have been working on during the last year. Regeneration and Greenbelt Greenfield Developments Wilton Park Beaconsfield An outline planning application for up to 350 homes as well as commercial and community development on this major developed site in the greenbelt was submitted in September 2017. The design proposals have taken longer to come to fruition than originally anticipated as we needed to ensure that the scheme met the requirements of this premium location as well as those expected by the Local Authority. We are already generating an annual rental stream of 1.0 million from 86 existing residential properties on this site valued at 46.9 million and which are included in the accompanying financial statements under investment properties. In addition the site generates approximately 0.5 million per annum from letting other space for storage and film production. We expect this 100 acre site to generate a gross development value of approximately 350 million. Wilton Park also sits within the proposed East of Beaconsfield Strategic Land release as proposed by South Bucks District Council and the current application ensures that it can accommodate further development on the site. Cheshunt Lakeside Cheshunt This is currently Inland Homes largest regeneration project comprising an emerging masterplan for a new mixed use Urban Village of up to 2000 new homes on 30 acres of land of which 18 acres are either owned or controlled by our joint venture company. The site sits immediately adjacent to Cheshunt Station 27 minutes to London Liverpool Street and the proposed new Crossrail 2 route. The setting is regarded by Broxbourne Borough Council as a key delivery location for much needed new homes and employment space in the Borough. Over the last year our land and planning team have assisted the Local Authority in increasing the development allocation from 1000 residential units to approximately 2000 units across the wider masterplan. The Group has a 50 interest in this development site and a planning application is expected to be submitted in December 2017 once we have successfully incorporated the requirements of key stakeholders and have a masterplan that can support the Borough through their Local Plan process. The resultant masterplan will include new community facilities a new two form entry primary school and employment space comprising uses such as offices healthcare business leisure restaurant and retail. 31 www.inlandhomes.co.uk STRATEGIC REPORT 25624.01 11 October 2017 425 PM Proof 2 Chief Executives Review Continued Chapel Riverside Southampton This regeneration site was secured by way of a Development Agreement with Southampton City Council whereby Inland Homes has obtained outline planning approval for 457 apartments plus 64000 sq ft of commercial space with a detailed approval for the first phase of 72 units which is now under construction. The gross development value of this site is expected to be in excess of 120 million and we anticipate the project will take approximately seven years to complete. Abbey Wharf Alperton London A resolution to grant planning consent was received for a first phase of 135 apartments in what is a new London Housing Zone. This site will kick start the regeneration and deliver some of the key requirements of the Housing Zone masterplan. The site was sold by the Group during the financial year generating a profit of 6.0 million. The Group has also secured a 29.5 million construction contract and construction is expected to commence in December 2017. Aston Clinton Road Aylesbury Significant technical and planning challenges including noise transport and drainage had to be overcome by the Inland Homes team in order to secure planning consent for 400 homes and 105000 sq ft of commercial space on this site which was owned by our joint venture company with Europa Capital. The joint venture company was sold in June 2017 resulting in a gain for the Group of 7.0 million. Town Centre Developments Sherbourne Wharf Birmingham Located 500 metres from Brindleyplace in Birmingham this welllocated City Centre site has received planning approval for the first two phases which will deliver a total of 167 canalside apartments.

Alastair Boyd Operations Manager Kraken 13 EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Producing the goods Kraken is transformational for EnQuest in the context of our production and cash generation performance. It is among the biggest operating assets when measured by production in the modern day UK North Sea. Following first oil on 23 June 2017 gross production rates of approximately 40000 Bopd were achieved towards the end of the year. With average gross production in the first two months of 2018 around 38000 Bopd and the targeted gross production of 50000 Bopd achieved in early 2018. This centrepiece development in EnQuests portfolio will drive production and cash flow growth which should enable the Group to begin reducing its debt. Delivering on objectives An interlinked series of factors contributed to successful delivery. These included A good understanding of a productive reservoir Exceptionally well mapped with 3D seismic used to place wells Two discovery wells and nine appraisal wells were drilled In total almost 50000 feet measured depth of reservoir section has been drilled to date Deep directional resistivity data acquired in all development wells Excellent drilling performance The rig deployed on Kraken was able to operate through challenging weather conditions with recorded downtime levels of less than 5 A highly experienced and competent rig crew delivered continuous improvements by utilising lessons learned in each phase Drilling at the second and third drill centres DCs were completed significantly ahead of schedule The team delivered the worlds longest open hole interval gravel packed with OptiPac screens at 4347 feet on DC3 A projectspecific model A comparatively small core team managed a limited number of larger contractors charged with delivering larger workscopes Fewer interfaces and greater scope for contractors to pursue efficient progress in their specialist areas underpinned our ability to deliver with agility and efficiency Triedandtested technologies and systems resulted in important cost efficiencies As a result of the above initiatives and a strong focus on cost control and commercial agreements the full cycle gross project capex is now expected to be approximately 2.3 billion down more than 25 from the projected figure of 3.2 billion at project sanction. By the end of 2017 three of Krakens four drill centres comprising 11 production wells and ten water injector wells were operational. With high levels of safety performance throughout 2017 and reservoir performance in line with original expectations the team is confident of maximising the longterm value of this landmark development. As one of the most significant oil field projects in the UK Continental Shelf successful production from Kraken is positive news for the whole basin. It has the potential to open up additional heavy oil opportunities in the Northern North Sea with other developments in the pipeline. Its particularly pleasing to see a project delivered under budget having clearly benefited from a strong partnership between operator and key service providers. Dr Andy Samuel UK Oil Gas Authority Chief Executive Kraken key facts A large heavy oil accumulation in the UK North Sea located approximately 125 kilometres east of the Shetland Islands Oil was found over 1000 metres below the seabed in a water depth of 116 metres Integrated production system where oil production is supported by water flooding and artificial lift to maximise areal sweep while maintaining voidage replacement Four drill centres of which three are currently drilled and commissioned comprising 13 horizontal production wells and 12 water injectors all tied back to the Kraken Floating Production Storage and Offloading FPSO vessel One of the largest FPSOs in the UK North Sea today 275 metres long and weighing 90000 tonnes liquid handling capacity of 80000 barrels per day of oil and 460000 barrels per day of water and significant oil storage capacity 600000 barrels Anticipated production life of 25 years at sanction Oil is offloaded onto shuttle tankers for onward delivery to global customers FOR MORE DETAILS SEE PAGES 08 to 11 and 26 14 EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2017 Photo credit BP Profitable longterm growth opportunities The right operator at the right time the fundamental principle behind EnQuests acquisition of interests in and operatorship of Magnus and associated infrastructure assets including the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal. MAGNUS SVT ACQUISITION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 EnQuest PLC Annual Report 2017 With their integrated skills operational scale cost structures and high levels of operating efficiency we have seen what EnQuest can do on the Thistle Deveron and Dons fields that were previously operated by BP. We believe this is a good example of having the right assets in the right hands offering new opportunities for the assets and benefiting the UKCS in the spirit of Maximising Economic Recovery MER UK. Mark Thomas BP North Sea Regional President Realising potential Our experience and track record of extending field lives and our ability to extract additional value from mature assets alongside our excellent Health Safety and Environmental performance positioned EnQuest as the ideal party to assume operatorship of the UK North Seas most northerly installation. Early in 2017 EnQuest agreed to acquire an initial 25 interest in Magnus as well as additional stakes in the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal SVT the Northern Leg Gas Pipeline and the Ninian Pipeline System from BP. At the time of the agreement announcement BP expressed its confidence in EnQuests ability to extend the productive life of Magnus and consequently support the Maximising Economic Recovery MER agenda for the UK North Sea. The innovative nature of the contract structure may serve as a model for the future transfer of mature assets from majors to operatorsofscale focused on maximising value and therefore as a template for the pursuit of the UKs MER goals. The terms of the initial deal mean there are no requirements for cash from EnQuest other than as generated from transaction assets and no exposure to cumulative negative cash flows.

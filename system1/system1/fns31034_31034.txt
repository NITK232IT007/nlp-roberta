Eurocell Markets and Drivers Despite a subdued RMI market and the prevailing economic uncertainty we are confident that our strategic initiatives described in Our Strategy on pages 20 and 21 including increasing market share continued expansion of the branch network and further expanding our use of recycled material will deliver above our market level growth rates for Eurocell. Private Home Improvement RMI The RMI market is subdued reflecting inter alia political uncertainty the unknown impact of Brexit the potential for further increases in interest rates and the relatively weak growth in real wages. Demand is influenced by the state of the economy as spend is often significant the state of the economy and the resulting impact on the housing market and consumer confidence influence demand. Housing market if the housing market is weak home owners may choose to improve or extend their existing property rather than move house which can be positive for Eurocell. Retirement housing planned improvements to retirement housing and increased availability of funds following changes to pension scheme rules may provide support to the RMI market in the future. Private New Build Housing New build growth has been strong in recent years and the large house builders continue to report good performance. Macroeconomic environment uncertainty suggests affordability will likely remain a key issue. Help to Buy scheme continues to support demand. Housing shortage ongoing positive government intervention remains a possibility. Public New Build Housing This sector represents a very small proportion of the UK housing market as government policies are targeted towards increasing private sector affordable housing rather than public sector social housing. Right to Buy scheme enables council and housing association tenants to buy their homes at a discount therefore a reduction in public sector housing stock is expected as result of the scheme. Rent caps may reduce the financing available for new development. Rental property development housing associations have relied on market sales to raise capital weaker house price growth and few transactions will likely hamper this. 8 EUROCELL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRa TEg IC REPORT Chief Executives Review Market Context I am pleased to report a strong performance for the Group. The Repair Maintenance and Improvement RMI market has been subdued during 2017 particularly during the second half reflecting low consumer confidence. We have experienced an almost perfect storm of macro factors including increasing political and economic risk the first interest rate rise in ten years worsening house price data low real wage growth and a weak pound driving material cost inflation. Against this more challenging backdrop we have made excellent progress with our strategic priorities continued to invest significantly in the growth of our business and made further gains in market share. Financial Performance We have reported robust financial results for 2017 and delivered higher revenues and profits. Overall sales growth was good at 8 excluding acquisitions. Growth was driven by our specifications teams which have continued to be successful in generating demand for our products with architects and planning authorities in the private new build sector and by the continued expansion of our branch network.

Book sales in the NonConsumer division grew by 5 but as expected the division saw a reduction in rights and services revenues following the end of the term of the Qatar contract and last years strong rights performance. A key strategic focus in 201617 was the Bloomsbury 2020 digital resources growth strategy. During the year we built a new platform to host our digital resources. Our programme is on schedule with two resources launched onto the new platform. We are encouraged that digital resources revenues exceeded our expectation growing by 50 year on year to 3.9 million. Our guidance on future investment and returns for this growth strategy is unchanged. Due to the strong trading in the year the Group was able to make a bonus provision of 1.0 million 2016 Nil. This has been a very strong year for Bloomsbury with excellent revenue growth in all our territories. Our Children s publishing in particular had an exceptional year delivering double digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. W e are wellplaced for the coming year. W e are launching three further major digital resources as planned and have an exciting publishing list from new and existing authors.

Other highlighted items in this period of 0.9 million are primarily as a result of the strategic restructuring of the US operation. The effective rate of tax for the year was 22 compared to 6 for the year ended 29 February 2016. The rate last year was low as it included the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses and a double tax relief benefit. Diluted earnings per share excluding highlighted items were 12.63 pence 2016 15.24 pence. Total diluted earnings per share for the year were 9.81 pence compared to 12.93 pence in 2016. Cash generation was strong with cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdraft of 15.5 million at 28 February 2017 2016 5.2 million. Our focus on working capital continues stock has reduced by 5 or 1.3 million year on year using constant currencies. We are working to achieve a similar stock reduction in the new financial year. Our strategic priority for cash is organic investment to grow and enhance our existing business. Including capital expenditure during the year we invested an additional 1.5 million of cash in Bloomsbury 2020. Another strategic priority for cash is the growth of our dividend. The Group has a progressive dividend policy while aiming to keep dividend earnings cover in excess of two. Investment in Bloomsbury 2020 is leading to earnings cover falling below that level in the shortterm but the dividend is underpinned by strong cash cover. The Board has committed during this period of investment to maintain its progressive dividend policy on the basis that earnings cover will improve as the return on Bloomsbury 2020 accrues. The Directors are therefore recommending a final dividend of 5.6 pence per share which subject to shareholder approval at our AGM on 18 July 2017 will be paid on 20 September 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 August 2017. Together with the interim dividend this makes a total dividend for the year ended 28 February 2017 of 6.7 pence per share a 5 increase on the 6.4 pence dividend for the year ended 29 February 2016. Including the full year dividend increase over the past 12 years the dividend has increased steadily at a compound annual growth rate of 7. Consumer division The Consumer division which consists of Adult and Childrens trade publishing has had an exceptional year significantly due to an excellent Childrens performance. Revenue for the division increased by 28 to 85.4 million 2016 66.4 million. Operating profit before highlighted items increased by 33 to 7.9 million 2016 6.0 million. There was good revenue growth in all territories 23 in Australia 17 in the US 55 in India and 21 in the UK all at constant currencies. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Dividend per share 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 The Academic division won a third Dartmouth medal in seven years to honour the creation of a reference work of outstanding quality and significance.

His stewardship in guiding us through the reinvention phase of our recent history has been invaluable and has protected and enhanced shareholder value for all concerned. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS STATEMENT ALAN KENTISH Chief Executive Officer I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE ANNUAL RESULTS FOR STM GROUP PLC FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017. ANNUAL REPORT ACCOUNTS 2017 12 OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW PENSIONS Our pensions businesses have all seen significant changes to their modus operandi following the UK Spring Budget. Total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to 10.2 million 2016 9.2 million and accounted for 47 of total Group revenue 2016 52. As predicted since the UK Spring Budget our Gibraltar operation has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS whilst Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA. Conversely our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new business growth. To put this in context for the nine months following the Budget new business numbers were 217 ROPS 2016 1224 administered by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs 2016 162 administered from our UK operations. Malta remains the largest of our three jurisdictions with pension turnover of 6.1 million 2016 6.5 million with Gibraltar generating 2.6 million 2016 2.4 million of turnover and finally in its first full year under STMs ownership the UK generated 1.5 million of revenue 2016 0.3 million. An important KPI remains the annual recurring revenue statistic which has been determined as the contractual element of any trustee fee due or any fees under the life assurance policies which are billed on an annual basis. For 2017 this amounted to 9.6 million 2016 8.5 million which represents 95 2016 93 of total pension revenue giving a highly visible and predictable future revenue stream. LIFE ASSURANCE The acquisition of London Colonial in late 2016 and with it the Gibraltar based life assurance company LCA has allowed STM to significantly grow its life assurance business. This is seen from the 2017 combined revenue figure of 5.9 million as compared to 2.8 million for 2016. Pleasingly organic growth for STM Life during the year has delivered a 26 uplift to generate turnover for 2017 of 2.4 million 2016 1.9 million. Within this revenue figure recurring revenue annual fees and investment income amounted to 1.8 million compared to 1.4 million in 2016. This provides a steady and highly visible annuity income stream. In addition LCA has performed as expected with its long standing and predictable customer base delivering a revenue of 2.2 million for the year with a further release from technical reserves of 1.3 million 2016 0.5 million as a result of the reduction in the administrative costs per policy. CORPORATE AND TRUSTEE SERVICES Turnover from the Corporate and Trustee Services CTS division for the year was 4.3 million 2016 4.4 million thus accounting for 20 of the Groups total turnover 2016 25. This business is generated in Jersey and Gibraltar with Jersey revenue accounting for circa 57 2016 56 of the CTS business at 2.5 million 2016 2.5 million and Gibraltar generating turnover of 1.8 million 2016 1.9 million. As noted in previous years reports the CTS environment and sector remains challenging and it is accepted by the Group that this will be a difficult segment to grow organically. OTHER TRADING DIVISIONS AND NEW INITIATIVES Trading in other divisions which are mainly insurance management and the Spanish office was broadly in line with management expectations. These are expected to continue at similar levels going forward having generated revenue of 1.2 million in the year 2016 1.1 million. FINANCIAL REVIEW PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR Profitability has seen a step change in 2017 compared to that of 2016 but reflects the hard work of building the infrastructure and business development function in previous years. Clearly the integration of the LCH acquisition has enabled us to restructure the cost base of those businesses acquired and ensured that profit margins were enhanced. Group revenue for 2017 amounted to 21.5 million 2016 17.4 million and as anticipated EBITDA Earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation has increased by 55 from 3.1 million in 2016 to 4.8 million in 2017. Reassuringly the amount of recurring annuity revenue business continues to increase and still accounts for 75 of 2017 total revenues 2016 75. Finance costs amounted to 0.3 million 2016 0.1 million and reflects the debt financing in place for the LCH acquisition. The depreciation and amortisation charge has in turn increased as a result of amortising the client portfolio acquired with LCH and the investment in offices across various jurisdictions. This is 0.5 million in 2017 2016 0.3 million. Profit before tax was 4.0 million for the year being a pleasing uplift of 43 above the 2016 PBT result of 2.8 million notwithstanding oneoff costs and the technical reserve release referred to above. TAX CHARGE AND EARNINGS PER SHARE The tax charge for the year was 0.1 million 2016 0.4 million. The tax charge for the year has been impacted by the refund received in Malta on tax due on dividends paid to companies outside the Group. Whilst the corporate rate on Malta profits is 35 the refund is 30 on tax due on dividends. In Maltas infancy and growing stage the tax charge was higher than the refund as profits were higher than dividends. This year dividends have been in excess of profits due to the payment of a dividend from last years reserves. Hence the refund is higher than the charge. But this is a oneoff and as profits in Malta become consistent year on year the position will stabilise and the Groups effective rate will remain at circa 15.

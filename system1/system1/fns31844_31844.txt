Alan Smith Chairman 2 October 2017 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 12 Overview The core ScS business has continued to focus on providing excellent choice value and quality for our customers and I am pleased to see this delivering record results in furniture and flooring sales. Furthermore our targeted investment in key growth areas continue to prove successful with an 8.3 increase in sales from our House of Fraser concessions and 12.3 growth in our online business. Results The Group saw a 15.7m 4.9 increase in revenue in the year to 333.0m 2016 317.3m. Gross profit increased to 153.7m 2016 149.1m EBITDA increased 8.4 to 17.4m 2016 16.0m and profit before tax rose 9.9 to 12.0m 2016 10.9m. Strategy for growth The Group continues to focus on four key areas in its strategy for growth Area 1 Increase sales densities Sales density per square foot at our ScS stores for the last 12 months was 226. This represents an increase of 7 per square foot or 3.2 on the 219 achieved in the 12 months ended 30 July 2016. This increase was achieved by continued focus on the following The ongoing targeting and maximisation of a branded range of products and the continued development of our flooring offering Maximising our average order value with furniture order values rising 1.1 in the year to 1575 and flooring order values rising 3.5 in the year to 629 Continued investment in our online capability resulting in both the benefit of direct sales through the website and the indirect benefit of improving the quality of footfall with customers often entering our stores having already researched their choices. This has ensured that despite decreases in footfall noted industrywide customers are more engaged and more likely to place an order and Improving the customer journey experience and confidence evidenced by an improved Trustpilot satisfaction score. The Group has over 73000 reviews and is proud to have improved its overall score and maintained its maximum 5star Excellent rating. Marketing spend increased to 24.7m in the year 2016 23.1m as the Group continued to operate in an increasingly competitive and challenging marketplace and to drive sales conversion namely the proportion of customers who purchased a product after entering a store which further increased this year. Area 2 Maximise the opportunity with House of Fraser customers The Group operates 27 House of Fraser concessions targeting those customers who prefer to shop in department stores and town centres and enabling the Group to access a wider demographic. Despite being integrated into the Group for over three years gross sales continued to rise strongly in the year increasing by 8.3 to 27.4m 2016 25.3m. Contribution to the Groups EBITDA is a continued focus as these concessions become established and following their first positive contribution in the prior year the House of Fraser concession EBITDA continued to strengthen in 2017. As with the ScS store network individual concession performance is regularly reviewed to ensure all locations make an appropriate level of return. Both ScS and House of Fraser management teams continue to recognise the ongoing potential that the partnership offers and continually work together on how to improve sales and margins. Area 3 Optimise online presence Whilst relatively large ticket home furnishings continue to be predominantly a storebased sale we know that a high proportion of our customers continue to research our products online before they visit the store to make their final purchase decision. Continued website investment has therefore been a key part of the Groups strategy for growth. In addition as the Group continues to improve its online presence and provide a higher quality responsive web platform an increasing number of customers are choosing to make their purchase directly online. This has been supported by continued investment in website development and maintenance of 1.8m 2016 1.4m and increased digital marketing spend which has successfully driven improvements in our website visitor count and conversion. Online gross sales increased 12.3 to 11.3m 2016 10.0m. Area 4 Achieve strong financial returns from new store openings During the first half of the financial year the Group opened four new stores in Aberdeen September 2016 and Thanet Edinburgh Straiton and Plymouth all on Boxing Day 2016. All four stores have performed in line with the targets set within their initial investment analysis and have contributed positively to EBITDA in the year.

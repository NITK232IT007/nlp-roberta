We will also drive the development of assets at the Definitive Feasibility Study andor Preliminary Feasibility Study stages encompassing Kekura where Government approval has been received for the development of a deposit of federal significance and infrastructure construction has commenced and Klen where we are planning additional exploration work. I would like to emphasise the importance we place on retaining our low cost producer credentials and I am pleased to report that our current ratios fully support our status as one of the most competitive gold mining companies in the world. Total Cash Costs amounted to US507 per oz in 2017 while our AllInSustaining Cash Costs totalled US664 per oz. This compares with US454 per oz and US652 per oz respectively in 2016. The average realised price of gold and gold equivalent during 2017 amounted to US1162 per oz compared with US1136 per oz in 2016 and should be seen against our AllInSustaining Cash Costs measurement. The average realised price of gold in respect of MNV and Belaya Gora was US1259 per oz during the year. Highland Gold Mining Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 7 STRATEGIC REPORT The combination of a stronger Russian rouble and the resulting slightly higher dollar production costs as well as our utilisation of low grade ore at Belaya Gora was reflected in a 4.4 reduction in EBITDA to US155.3 million in 2017 compared with US162.5 million in 2016. In line with this our EBITDA margin declined to 49.0 2016 53.1. Net debt as at 31 December 2017 amounted to US198 million versus US205 million as at 31 December 2016. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains stable at 1.28 2016 1.26. Your Directors recognise the Companys commitment to the return of profits to shareholders through dividend payments and towards the end of last year we decided to clarify such intentions by way of adopting a more formalised dividend policy. The key aspects of the policy are as follows The Company aims to pay a dividend that takes into account its cash generation profitability balance sheet strength and capital investment requirements The Company anticipates that the total dividend distribution for each financial year will be 20 of net cash flow from operating activities and The Board may recommend the distribution of additional cash on the balance sheet through increased or special dividends should such funds not be required for capital expenditure or debt repayment. In the wake of such considerations the Board is pleased to recommend the payment of a second interim dividend of 0.0542 per share 2016 final dividend 0.054 per share which will make a total distribution of 0.104 per share 2016 0.104 per share for the financial year to 31 December 2017. As evidenced above and in the ensuing sections 2017 has witnessed sound progress on numerous fronts. Your Board has every confidence that such progress will serve to deliver further returns to shareholders in the future. It is with deep regret that I have to report the occurrence of a fatality at our Novo underground mine on 13 April 2017 as well as a lamentable increase in Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate LTIFR to 4.88 in 2017 compared to 2.30 in 2016. A thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the fatality has been carried out as well as a comprehensive review of our health and safety system implemented by a new highlyqualified HSE team. Among the results of this effort is a new set of cardinal rules of safety behaviour at each of our production sites more details on this programme in the Operational Review. I would now like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board to thank all of our employees for the hard work and commitment that was integral to all that has been achieved in our Anniversary Year. Eugene Shvidler Executive Chairman Highland Gold Mining Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8 Strategic Report CEOs Report Denis Alexandrov It is gratifying to report that the extensive exploration and development activity undertaken by Highland Gold during 2016 and 2017 has been rewarded with a material 56 increase in your Companys ore reserves proven and probable to 5.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent as at 31 December 2017 compared with 3.3 Moz at yearend 2016. This JORCcompliant reserve estimation as at 31 December 2017 was accompanied by notification of a similarly compliant 6.6 increase in the Companys mineral resources measured indicated and inferred from 16.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent to 17.2 Moz on a yearonyear basis. At the same time the average grade of ore reserves was lowered from 8.0 gt at yearend 2016 to 3.3 gt at yearend 2017 due to lower cutoff grades and increased ore tonnage at our Novo and Belaya Gora operations and the inclusion of the Blagodatnoye deposit. Last year I emphasised the importance we attached to our Khabarovsk Baikal and Chukotka cluster initiative in order to drive overall development by focusing our activities in key geographic regions and maximising synergies. The potential benefits of this approach are well illustrated by recent developments at Belaya Gora Khabarovsk cluster where our Preliminary Feasibility Study PFS largely compiled in 2017 and published post the financial yearend envisages an integrated Belaya Gora Blagodatnoye operation with combined gold reserves of 932000 oz more than triple Belaya Goras 291000 oz recorded at the outset of 2017. Grade was reduced to 1.44 gt versus 3.3 gt for Belaya Gora alone. Average annual gold production is estimated at 55000 oz with the life of the combined mine forecast to extend Stable production to 2032 and estimated average TCC of US802.

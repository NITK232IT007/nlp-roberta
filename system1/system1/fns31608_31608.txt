Healthcare The Diploma Healthcare Group DHG operates in three principal geographies Canada Australasia and Europe. In Canada DHG supplies to the ca. 600 public hospitals across the country as well as to private clinics and pathology laboratories. Somagen Diagnostics Somagen supplies a range of consumables and instruments used in the diagnostic testing of blood tissue and other samples. It is also a leading supplier to the growing cancer screening and the assisted reproductive technology ART markets.

Abacus ALS is in the process of being combined with Diagnostic Solutions DS to form abacus dx a larger broader based clinical diagnostics business supplying to both public and private laboratories.

The a1CBISS business based in the UK supplies equipment and services for the monitoring and control of environmental emissions as well as a range of gas detection devices. Market drivers The DHG businesses in Canada supply into areas of Healthcare which are predominantly public sector funded. Private sector funding representing ca. 30 of Healthcare expenditure in Canada is largely focused on areas where DHG do not participate specifically dental cosmetic and eye surgery and pharmaceuticals. The principal demand driver for DHG in Canada is therefore the sustainable level of Healthcare spending funded by the Canadian Government. The Canadian Health Act the Act ensures universal coverage for all insured persons for all medically necessary services provided by hospitals physicians and other Healthcare providers. A growing ageing and well educated population demands high standards of service delivery helping to ensure ongoing growing demand.

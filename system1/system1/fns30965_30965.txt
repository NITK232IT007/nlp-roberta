However that said our people have worked successfully in similar market environments before and will undoubtedly do so again. We expect continued growth through exploration and development together with increased production at San Julin further improvements in performance at Fresnillo completion of the new Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura and the commissioning of the new Pyrites plant at Saucito. These projects will lead to increased production with associated costs though we will continue to seek corresponding efficiencies from other operations. A strong balance sheet targeted investment and operating costs amongst the lowest in the industry will again be the defining characteristics of our Company. In particular I look forward to our project at Juanicipio moving from exploration to the development stage subject to Board approval in April 2018. Our new approach to health and safety is set to be rolled out to all mines and this should lead to an improved system that will benefit all employees and contractors. In conclusion I would like to thank our people communities suppliers clients and shareholders for their continued support during the last year. Together we face the future with cautious confidence.

Our capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US604.8 million while we invested US141.1 million in exploration activities and paid dividends of US236.6 million. HIGH QUALITY ASSETS LONGTERM VISIBILITY LONG LIFE RETURNS We are one of Mexicos largest concession holders with approximately 1.8 million hectares of surface land. Our district consolidation strategy enables us to leverage local knowledge and shared infrastructure. Our portfolio of low cost gold and silver mines high potential development projects and advanced exploration prospects contain over 2320 moz of attributable silver resources and 38.5 moz of gold resources. LOW COST AND FLEXIBLE OPERATIONS HEALTHY MARGINS ADAPTABILITY ACROSS PRICE CYCLES The quality of our assets means that we are able to extract mineral profitably across metal price cycles. We maximise the potential of each operation by customising mine plans leveraging technology and sharing personnel expertise and plant capacity across our districts. We continue to seek and implement new ways to improve efficiency optimise our consumption of materials and energy and maintain our position as a low cost producer. DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT LONGTERM PROFITABLE GROWTH Before we embark on a development project we apply stringent viability criteria covering areas such as rates of return and high environmental and social impact standards. We set delivery timelines and budgets to meet production targets in the context of market conditions and maintain control by carrying out engineering and construction activities. Having successfully implemented the second phase of the San Julin mine in 2017 we are on track to deliver the new Pyrites plant at Saucito and the second line of the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura both in 2018. SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP SOCIAL LICENCE TO OPERATE ETHICAL CULTURE Our ability to create value for all our stakeholders and ensure operational continuity is built on a series of commitments to sustainability to understand and respect the needs of local communities to prioritise local goods services and employees to ensure the health and safety of our people and to minimise our impact on the environment. During 2017 we invested over US30.9 million in our HSECR initiatives up 41 compared with the previous year.

While others react to market pressures by pulling back on their efforts we maintain a strategic commitment to continuous exploration across all precious metals price cycles. The result A steady pipeline of reserves and resources that fuels our ability to deliver growth and returns not just this year or next year but in the decades ahead. GROWTH Around US1.5 billion invested in exploration since 2008. Number of fulltime geologists almost doubled from 55 in 2009 to 100 in 2017. Close to 900 kilometres drilled at our operations and projects by the exploration teams in 2017. RETURNS Around 300 local community personnel employed as assistants to our geologists. Increase in silver resources from 1.1 bnoz in 2008 to 2.3 bnoz in 2017. Increase in gold resources from 12 moz in 2008 to 38.5 moz in 2017.

WE DRILLED THE FIRST TEST HOLE IN 2006 AND SINCE 2008 HAVE INVESTED APPROXIMATELY US81.5 M IN EXPLORATION. THIS ACTIVITY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AT SAN JULIN AND WE BELIEVE THERE IS STILL FURTHER POTENTIAL IN THE DISTRICT. IN 2017 FOR EXAMPLE WE CONTINUED OUR INTENSIVE EXPLORATION PROGRAMME DRILLING 73995 METRES PRIMARILY ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT WHERE NUMEROUS TARGETS ARE YET TO BE TESTED.

Each segment has a clear focused offering to the customers that they serve. These divisions have the skills and experience to meet the needs of our customers and work effectively in these markets. This allows them to provide expert contribution and innovation to achieve added value to the work streams. From 1 January 2018 the Civils division will be absorbed into the NMCNomenca division which in turn forms part of the Water segment. From 1 January 2018 the Board will review the Groups operational performance via two segments the Water segment NMCNomenca and Nomenca divisions and the Built Environment segment Telecommunications Highways and Construction divisions Overview of 2017 This year has been a period of continuing to strengthen the business in preparation for a sustainable growth in quality of earnings and respectable dividend yields. Further significant investment has been made in implementing governance controls to manage risk and into the development of our people to meet the increasing demands of our customers for a highquality service. The Group is now well positioned to take advantage of the increase in infrastructure spending plans that prevail. The net return is disappointing and has been significantly impacted by the remaining legacy contract. The underlying profitability cash generation and secured workload for 2018 are the significant positives which give the Board confidence for the Groups future. Underlying profit 40.44 8.30m 2016 5.91m Operating profit 46.88 1.19m 2016 2.24m 34 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 The underlying profitability in the year of 8.30 million is a significant increase on the previous year. Overall coordination of our activities is carried out through the Executive Leadership Team ELT which is chaired by the Chief Executive. Membership consists of the Finance Director Directors of the divisions and the central services functions. The overarching purpose of this body is to ensure consistency of best practice and to drive performance improvement across all of our activities. Group financial performance The growth in turnover of 16.48 to 291.77 million 2016 250.49 million is encouraging and is borne from our vision of growing revenues in our chosen markets with our repeat and framework clients. It is also very encouraging to see the level of new customers and enquiries in 2017 achieved through the quality of customer experience that the Group delivers. Although not at the level the Board finds acceptable an operating profit of 1.19 million 2016 2.24 million has been achieved in the year. The underlying profitability in the year of 8.30 million 2016 5.91 million is a significant increase on the previous year and shows the exceptional performance in the main of the continuing business segments. The impact of the legacy contract has once again reduced the net margin return as highlighted in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and on page 91. The current tax debit of 0.26 million 2016 0.57 million credit arises due to current tax on profits at 19.25 in addition to a reduction in the deferred tax rate applicable to taxable temporary differences. Total comprehensive income for the year has reduced to 0.74 million 2016 2.63 million and in turn earnings per share has reduced to 7.31p 2016 25.95p. The Board is proposing to retain the final dividend at 3.0p taking the total dividend for the year to 6.0p 2016 4.5p. The total dividend is only covered 1.22 times 2016 5.80 times and has been proposed as an exceptional dividend as per the Groups dividend policy and is due to the underlying performance of the Group the cash generation and the secured workload for 2018. The Board anticipates an improving performance for 2018 and beyond. Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession before 31 December 2013 and which carried a high contractual and commercial risk. These contracts have negatively impacted the Groups income statement in 2013 and subsequent years. As at 31 December 2017 there is only one legacy contract remaining. In the year to 31 December 2017 the total loss before tax recognised on legacy contracts was 7.29 million 2016 3.85 million. During the year to 31 December 2016 the Group completed all onsite works for the one remaining legacy contract thereby removing any further uncertainty around costs to fulfil the contract. Contract revenue on the one remaining legacy contract has been recognised based on the prudent best estimate of the Directors as at 31 December 2017 of the amount recoverable from the client with an amount outstanding included within trade receivables. Following a High Court ruling towards the end of 2017 which did not support the application of the well established prevention principle in relation to this contract the Company has been granted leave to appeal this decision by the Court of Appeal. On the advice of the Companys lawyers the Directors will vigorously pursue this appeal but have decided to make a further provision against the outstanding debt. This matter will be kept under constant review and further announcements will be made if appropriate.

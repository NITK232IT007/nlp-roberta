Christopher Mills Nonexecutive Chairman 14 March 2018 EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc Annual Report 2017 9 1.0 Strategic Review Chief Executives Review It is pleasing to be able to report a strong set of results for 2017. In particular cash generation has once again been very strong with net cash growing from 2.2m to 7.0m during the year despite spending 1.4m on capital expenditure and 1.5m on the cancellation of share options. Operations We have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of driving the existing business and continuing to reduce cost. Gross margins have improved at a greater rate than the increase in sales. We have sold around 15000 analysers and 70 million tests during the year and cemented our place as number one supplier of Beta Hydroxybutyrate HB reagent in the USA and number two worldwide in Hemoglobin pointofcare products. During the year we completed the restructuring of our manufacturing operations by closing our manufacturing facility in Poland. Production volume was shifted to our factory in Barleben Germany and customers successfully transitioned away from the older style cuvette previously made in Poland. In Barleben we have invested in modern production equipment including new automated equipment for the manufacture and packaging of the Quo Test cartridge. At our Elkhart facility where we manufacture a number of wet chemistry products we have a medium term programme to update the facilities to improve quality and volumes. PointofCare EKFs pointofcare business model continues to be to sell analysers into the market and then benefit from the ongoing revenue stream generated by sales of the dedicated consumables. Over the last five years we have sold over 65000 analysers for use worldwide and each year we supply a growing number of tests for use on these. Hematology Sales of Hematology products have increased by 10 to 12.9m 2016 11.7m. Sales of Hemo Control sold in the USA as HemoPoint H2 have built on the strong growth in 2016 rising a further 7 while DiaSpect revenues have risen by a further 23. Diabetes Diabetes revenues are up by 13 at 11.5m 2016 10.2m. The Saudi tender won in 2015 was completed during the year and this has led to an increase in QuoT est and QuoLab sales of 14. There has been further success for Biosen sales which have risen by 10. Central Laboratory Central laboratory sales have grown by 5 to 12.6m from 12.1m last year again driven by sales of HB Liquicolor reagent which are higher by a further 17 having risen by a very significant percentage in 2016. We have continued to promote our Altair 240 analyser through an increasing portfolio of specialist distributors. Sales of other Central Laboratory products have been stable. We have discontinued a number of the marginal former STI products. New and updated products We have concentrated in 2017 on widening the range of regulatory approvals for our existing product ranges. In particular we have conducted a number of clinical trials in the USA in anticipation of submitting applications for FDA approval in the USA for our DiaSpect Tm and QuoTest products. QuoTest is also in the lab testing phase of its China FDA registration and we have secured registration for it in Brazil alongside Hemo Control DiaSpect Tm and QuoLab. POC Connect our connectivity solution for our DiaSpect Tm handheld analyser was launched in November 2017. We will soon be showcasing our new and updated Lactate Scout 4.0 product. As noted above we are working to secure commercial launch of our sTNFR biomarker for early detection of end stage renal disease in diabetic patients alongside a number of partners. Outlook We are looking forward to finalising our two FDA applications in the first half of 2018 and to update on progress with our sTNFR project. At the same time we anticipate receiving completed registrations for Beta Hydroxybutyrate HB in Mexico Brazil and Colombia as well as the Indian registration of DiaSpect Tm all in the first half of 2018. We are continuing to work hard to increase efficiency and reduce costs by investing in automation and streamlining processes. We are confident that we will continue to see growth in the business on a steady and sustainable basis.

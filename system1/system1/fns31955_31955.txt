As expected this type of early adopter activity has been seen recently from certain of the Groups clients. The average tenure of client relationship has increased over the past two years from five years to six years which implies that a greater proportion of the client base has experienced a full Emerging Markets cycle and seen the value opportunities that can arise. It also means that the potential for crossselling increases as clients become more familiar with the breadth and depth of the Emerging Markets asset classes and with Ashmores ability to identify attractive investment opportunities. The Emerging Markets allocation opportunity described above is substantial and predominantly relates to developed world institutions. However there is an additional source of AuM growth accessed through the third phase of the Groups strategy which seeks to manage capital for investors domiciled in the emerging world. Success here is illustrated by the 33 of the Groups AuM that is sourced from such clients through global client relationships and Ashmores network of local asset management platforms. Cost efficiency The Group takes a disciplined approach to operating costs and during the year cost savings achieved in the global business units have enabled continued investment in the rapidlygrowing local businesses for example in Colombia Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Group headcount has fallen over the period which largely reflects natural levels of turnover and where business processes have been made more efficient. In November 2016 the Group consolidated its US operations into its operating hub in New York. This locates specialist equities investment professionals alongside distribution and support functions and will deliver operational efficiencies through the combination of the offices. Brexit In March 2017 the UK formally started the process to leave the European Union EU triggering a twoyear period to determine the exit terms for the UK Brexit. However there remains uncertainty regarding the terms on which the UK will leave and the implications for the UK financial services industry notably for Ashmore regarding the passporting of services into and out of the EU. Ashmore will continue to monitor developments closely and will take appropriate action once there is greater clarity. For now the direct operational implications of Brexit are deemed manageable. Outlook As described in the Market review the performance of Emerging Markets assets over the past year has been strong. However given the significant price moves and macroeconomic adjustments undertaken over the past cycle there remains substantial value available across the Emerging Markets asset classes in absolute terms but also relative to developed world assets. Ashmores strategy to capitalise on Emerging Markets growth its proven investment processes and its efficient business model mean it is in a strong position to continue to deliver superior investment performance for clients to raise investor allocations to Emerging Markets and to generate further value for shareholders. People and culture Ashmores distinctive culture underpinned by its remuneration philosophy that places an emphasis on payforperformance and longdated equity incentivisation has withstood another market cycle. The superior investment performance and improving financial performance delivered over the past year together with strategic and operational developments are testament to the hard work of all employees for which I would like to say thank you on behalf of all shareholders.

The average AuM level during the period along with the average margins achieved determines the level of management fee revenues. The proportion of relevant Group AuM that is outperforming benchmarks on a gross basis over one year three years and five years. The gross basis reflects the largely institutional nature of the client base typically with the ability to agree bespoke fee arrangements. Funds without a performance benchmark are excluded specifically those in the Alternatives and Overlayliquidity themes. Relevance to strategy The Groups strategy seeks to capitalise on the growth trends across Emerging Markets. This is ultimately reflected in AuM growth over time. The Groups success is dependent on delivering investment performance for clients who typically look at performance over the medium to long term. Longterm performance Assets under management Investment performance three years AuM increased by 12 through net inflows of US1.9 billion and positive investment performance of US4.2 billion. Average AuM increased by 5 to US54.8 billion. Ashmore continues to deliver strong investment performance for clients over one three and five years.

See more on P26 and 58 PROGRESS UPDATE Svetloye AlbazinoAmursk Komar and Varvara Kapan In 2017 the Svetloye heap leach operation was rampedup to full capacity making a substantial contribution to the Groups strong performance. Just one year after launch Svetloye delivered superior results with GE production of 106 Koz compared with 23 Koz in 2016 and was the lowest cost operation with TCC of US313GE oz on the back of exceptional operational delivery and positive grade reconciliations. In 2017 AlbazinoAmursk achieved record gold production of 269 Koz up 10 yearonyear while advancing the debottlenecking project. The production increase was primarily driven by higher hourly productivity and recovery levels as well as significant improvement in head grades. At the Amursk POX plant a record recovery of 97 .2 was achieved in Q4 2017 due mostly to the automation of the material flow control system and expansion of the water treatment section. Almost 2 Mt of Komar ore was railed to the Varvara hub resulting in record GE production of 130 Koz up 54 yearonyear. In 2018 additional Komar ore will displace the lowergrade material from the Varvara deposit increasing production and reducing costs at the Varvara processing hub. To further streamline logistics and reduce haulage costs a new railway spur has been commissioned at Komar. In 2017 full year gold production at Kapan reached a record 50 Koz of GE. The strong operational performance at Kapan was driven by increased processing volumes and improved head grades on the back of ongoing measures to debottleneck the underground mine and improve recovery levels. This will continue in 2018 along with active exploration within the region.

We are aiming to deliver the first gold at Kyzyl in Q3 2018 and ramp up the debottlenecking project at the Amursk POX in line with this.

With its large highgrade reserves long mine life and lowcapital intensity it is set to create significant shareholder returns Construction activities are now focused on the installation of smaller technological equipment and Kyzyl is on track to produce the first concentrate in Q3 2018. First ore has already been mined from the openpit ahead of schedule in January 2018. There is a strong demand for concentrate from multiple offtakers with the first contract signed in Q1 2018. Expansion of Amursk POX plant targets an increase in POX capacity enabling Polymetal to retain approximately 50 of Kyzyl concentrate for inhouse treatment as opposed to a thirdparty offtake. This is expected to improve effective gold recovery from concentrate as well as bring down processing and transportation costs. The debottlenecking project at the Amursk POX is progressing on schedule. Polymetal plans to ramp up the debottlenecked POX plant in the second half of 2018 in time to take first feed from the Kyzyl concentrator. Polymetal is continuing to undertake extensive metallurgical testwork and evaluate its ability to use high temperature 230240C POX technology to process highcarbon Kyzyl concentrate and thirdparty feedstocks. The project will enable Polymetal to materially improve the economics of refractory gold projects by increasing gold recovery from concentrates and bringing down processing and transportation costs and will also strengthen Polymetals commercial position on the concentrate market visvis offtakers. A decision on construction of the second POX is expected in late 2018 in conjunction with the rampup of Kyzyl and an investment decision on Nezhda project.

The initial Ore Reserve estimate JORC for Nezhda reaffirmed its economic viability with openpit ore reserves 2 estimated at 15.5 Mt of ore with an average GE grade of 4.0 gt for 2.0 Moz of GE contained. Additional mineral resources are estimated at 55.9 Mt of ore with an average GE grade of 5.0 gt for 8.9 Moz of GE contained. Production is currently projected to startduring in 2022.

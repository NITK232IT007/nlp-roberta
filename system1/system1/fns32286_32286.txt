This year weve unveiled our new business unit structure and corporate strategy to continue on this journey. Financial strength enables an organisation to take choices about how it deploys resources and the services it prioritises. In the following sections we have summarised the choices we have made. We are a strong financially viable organisation with an efficient operating model that delivers Value for Money and we are well placed to continue supplying new homes to meet the strong housing demand in our geographic area. We exist to help those who can not currently afford to rent or buy through the private market to access a home. We continue to operate within a tight geographical area between Oxford and Cambridge centred on Bedford. These areas have some of the most expensive housing in the country where house prices are commonly between 1012 times the average salary. Whilst this is generally an economically active area with high levels of employment there are some areas of economic deprivation. Across the region many people in low paid employment can not access housing privately so the need for affordable housing remains acute. We serve a diverse customer group including tenants shared owners and Help to Buy customers with a range of ages and economic circumstance who have different service requirements. It is important that we continue to supply a range of dwelling types of different sizes and tenures to meet the varied needs of our demographic groups. Our ambition has not changed to build or supply homes to as many people in need as we can manage our housing assets and tenancies as efficiently as possible and deliver a service that provides exceptional Value for Money for our customers. But how we work is changing and this year we have restructured the organisation to work through a new business model. We now have seven business units along with a number of support services. To grow successfully we recognise we need to invest in our support infrastructure and to continuously improve our customer offering. Our new business units will help inform decisions through improved metrics facilitate clearer reporting and help deliver greater Value for Money during the year ahead and in years to come.

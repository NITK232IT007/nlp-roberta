Operating these schemes has become unattractive and more costly for employers over the last decade and this has created an opportunity for guaranteed income providers to derisk fully or partially an employers existing defined benefit obligations to its members. Taking the risk out of paying company pensions Defined benefit derisking can occur via a Buyin whereby a pension scheme pays a single premium to an insurance company to purchase an income stream that matches its obligations to its members but retains legal responsibility for those obligations. An alternative is a Buyout where a pension scheme removes its obligations by purchasing individual insurance policies to replicate its obligations to some or all of its pension scheme members who then become customers of the derisking provider. The solutions for derisking can be medically underwritten meaning that insurers use individual members medical and lifestyle information to assess their longevity as opposed to relying on proxies such as the members age pension amount and possibly postcode. For some schemes medically underwritten pricing is typically better value than traditional nonmedically underwritten pricing. Defined benefit pension schemes with fewer members offer the greatest opportunity for medical underwriting to deliver benefits. This potentially occurs if there are a small number of scheme members with a high proportion of the schemes liabilities that are assessed by using medical underwriting to have life expectancies below average. Medical underwriting has become well established in the defined benefit derisking market and its benefits are well understood. Current market and outlook There are approximately 2tn in UK defined benefit pension scheme obligations source PPF which is driving high demand for derisking solutions with Buyin transactions forecast over the next decade to be approximately 350bn source Hymans Robertson. While insurer capacity will increase in the long term over the medium term we believe the demand for derisking solutions exceeds the current supply available from providers. The defined benefit derisking market is projected to grow further over the next decade with transactions expected to double to over 30bn per year. This level of activity would result in only 2 of total defined benefit pension assets each year being derisked providing significant potential upside. The total volume of derisking transactions in 2017 is expected to exceed 10bn source LCP. The capacity of companies to deliver derisking solutions is constrained. Defined benefit pension schemes are competing for the same resources as a number of life insurance companies who have explored or are exploring selling their large books of Guaranteed Income for Life business.

The solution provides people with peace of mind from the security of knowing the income will continue to be paid for as long as the customer and where relevant for as long as they or typically their spouse lives. In the UK GIfLs traditionally offered an income payable without reference to the individuals health or lifestyle and were differentiated only by reference to a limited number of factors such as age postcode premium size and prior to 31 December 2012 gender. An individually underwritten GIfL takes into account an individuals medical conditions and lifestyle factors to determine their life expectancy. People who are eligible and purchase an individually underwritten GIfL typically achieve double digit percentage increases in income compared to purchasing a GIfL which is not individually underwritten. 07 Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 0 20 40 60 80 100 85 of DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION schemes are closed increasingly to future accrual as well as new members 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Closed to new members Closed to future accrual Source The Purple Book 2017 PPF Expected growth in DB derisking transactions bn 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 forecast BuyinBuyout Backbook acquisition Source Just analysis Hymans Robertson LCP 5.2 4.4 7.5 13.2 12.3 9.0 10.2 12.0 External GIfL market m 2015 Source Just analysis ABI 2016 2017 1728 1917 2119 CAGR 10.7 Base case Potential Source Just estimates potential external gifl market size 2020 bn 2016 Demographic Previous zero income Drawdown Guaranteed annuity rate Individual DB transfers Life insurance companies 2020 forecast 2.0 2.9 1.9 4.9bn CAGR 1 1 Providing security and peace of mind The proportion of people purchasing an individually underwritten GIfL is continuing to increase and our view is this will become the minimum standard for all providers over the next few years.

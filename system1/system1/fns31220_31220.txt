In 2014 the Company released the findings of the mining consultant Venmyn Deloittes Competent Persons Report on the mine which demonstrated JORC reserves of 2.26Moz JORC resources of 5.14Moz and a development plan to increase annual gold production to 100000oz. This is to be achieved by accessing higher grade reserves through the continued development of the underground mine and by increasing the processing plants throughput capacity from the current 850000t per year to 1 million tonnes per year. The extraction of the gold reserves is now undertaken solely from the underground mine. The Company is in the process of enhancing the production from the underground mine gradually increasing production with the aim to achieve upto 1000000t in the future. 1 Karasuyskoye Ore Fields In May 2016 the Company was awarded the subsoil exploration contract to conduct further testing at the site Karasuyskoye ore field for the 6 year term with the right to extend for another 4 years in case of commercial discovery of resources. The geological data that the Company acquired indicates that there are several mineralised zones at Karasuyskoye and this leads the Company to believe that this project has the potential to contain significant gold resources. The Company is validating the geological data by twinning previous drill holes and undertaking additional metallurgical test work. The initial results are very encouraging and this work will facilitate the preparation of an independent Competent Persons Report CPR to international standards it is to be completed in the near term. On completion of the CPR the Company envisages progressing towards mining from the Karasuyskoye Ore Fields initially using cash generated from existing operations external funding will be considered as the project progresses and the cost of development is considered. 2 Strategic report At a glance ......................................................................................

Dear shareholders We were expecting to be moving forward towards the targets set in the prior year in terms of production however our progress was held back by the lack of equipment. Positive progress was made in developing the underground mine in relation to the ore bodies and infrastructure. However the lack of equipment had a direct effect on the level of output and grade achieved. During the year in order to move the project forward which requires capital investment a great deal of work was done with investment advisors and potential lenders. The potential offers were carefully vetted and assessed to ensure that the finance to be provided was the correct fit for the Company. This necessarily involved additional time and resources and the time lines were extended to those originally envisaged. The management are working to ensure that the current funding being accessed for the required investment in equipment is at a competitive price for the shareholders and affordable for the Company. To this end they have identified two sources that will provide the necessary funding required to move the project forward and are currently in the final stages of confirming the funding. During the year the Company maintained tight control of costs to conserve working capital with further savings being made in 2018 both at head office and at subsidiary Company level in Kazakhstan. At Head Office the administrative costs have been reduced by cutting office and professional fees. In the subsidiaries rent travel and other overheads have been reduced. In Q1 2018 these have been further reduced. Employment costs have been reduced with a rationalisation of the workforce principally at the mine site. During the year the Company met its commitment to repay the balance of the EBRD loan which was settled in October 2017. The consequent finance cash flows in relation to servicing of this debt will prove useful in meeting its obligations on any new financial liability. The decline has now progressed down to 150masl and a number of ore bodies are now accessible to progress 2018 production. Underground development 150masl The decline is now at 150masl and a number of ore bodies are now accessible to progress production in 2018 We are confident from the work conducted so far that the mine will generate a very good return to the shareholders. The underground asset and infrastructure have been developed so that it can deliver the production required via the new range of equipment to be purchased. This is expected to quickly transform the productive capacity and move towards the targeted output levels.

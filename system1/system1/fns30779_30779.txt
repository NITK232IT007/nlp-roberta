Dean Finch Group Chief Executive 1 March 2018 Annual Report 2017 National Express Group PLC 18 Chief Executives review Delivering further significant growth in profit and cash The strength of the financial performance delivered in 2017 demonstrates the Groups strong and stable financial position. Chris Davies Group Finance Director Statutory profit 2017 m 2016 m Normalised profit before tax 200.0 168.6 UK restructuring 5.6 Intangible amortisation on acquired businesses 38.0 33.8 Statutory profit before tax 156.4 134.8 Tax charge 28.0 19.9 Statutory profit after tax from continuing operations 128.4 114.9 Profit from discontinued operations 5.9 5.1 Statutory profit for the period 134.3 120.0 Restated in relation to the exit from UK rail The exit from our UK rail operations with the strategic disposal of the Groups final UK rail franchise c2c in February 2017 led to a reorganisation of the UK management structure and a oneoff cash inflow of 27.5 million. The aggregated impact of the UK rail exit including the c2c disposal and the consequent UK restructuring has been a small profit after tax which has been excluded from normalised results. The gross profit on the sale of the c2c franchise and the discontinuation of other direct UK rail costs 5.9m after tax is separated on the income statement from the associated costs of restructuring the UK business 5.6m. Further detail can be found in note 11 to the financial statements. Revenue m 2016 revenue 2094 Currency translation 94 2016 revenue at constant currency 2188 Organic growth 54 Acquisitions 79 2017 revenue 2321 Group revenue for the period was 2321.2 million 2016 2093.7m an overall increase of 6.1 on a constant currency basis up 10.9 on a reported basis with 94 million of foreign currency gains on translation. Revenue growth of 54 million from our existing businesses representing organic growth of 2.5 was boosted by a further 79 million from acquisitions principally in North America and Spain. Revenue growth has been delivered across the business with performance particularly strong in our overseas businesses. North America delivered 10.1 growth in constant currency with growth being driven by the full year benefit of acquisitions completed in 2016 augmented by the three new bolton acquisitions made in the second half of 2017. Organic growth benefitted from another successful bidding season in which we achieved an average price increase of 2.4 across the entire portfolio and 3.0 on those contracts up for bid and renewal. ALSA also delivered a strong performance with revenue growth of 3.6 on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven predominantly in Spain most notably on our Spanish long distance routes where our revenue management system contributed 3.9 to revenue growth on our long haul services. This was augmented by six bolton acquisitions made in the year. Dear shareholders I am delighted to be writing to you for the first time as Group Finance Director of National Express. The strength of the financial performance delivered in 2017 and outlined below demonstrates the Groups strong and stable financial position. Presentation of results To supplement IFRS reporting we also present our results on a normalised basis which shows the performance of the business before intangible amortisation for acquired businesses US tax reform profit for the year from discontinued operations and consequent UK restructuring. The Board believes that this gives a more comparable yearonyear indication of the operating performance of the Group and allows the users of the financial statements to understand managements key performance measures. Unless otherwise noted all references to profit measures throughout this review are for continuing operations for both the current and prior reporting period. Changes to reporting segments Following the strategic exit from UK rail operations in February 2017 the UK business was restructured with UK Bus and UK Coach combined under a single UK management structure to drive cost reductions and facilitate better clearer decision making. To align external reporting with internal decision making structures we are presenting the UK as a single operating segment. We will continue to disclose revenue separately for our UK bus and coach operations on the Group website www.nationalexpressgroup.com in order to provide an understanding of drivers of performance in the UK division. Statutory profit The Group again delivered a record statutory profit after tax amounting to 128.4 million 2016 114.9m driving basic earnings per share of 25.7 pence 2016 23.0p an increase of 11.7.

Organic growth was boosted by acquisitions made in 2016 and 2017 with those acquisitions made in 2016 achieving returns of at least 15. In ALSA normalised operating profit increased by 4.4 on a constant currency basis driven by a combination of organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions made in 2016 and 2017 together with cost efficiencies and lower fuel costs. Reported normalised operating profit increased by 12.0.

Central costs have increased by 6.8 million reflecting strategic investment in a number of Groupwide initiatives together with a new International Development Team.

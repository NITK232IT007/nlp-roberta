Our strategy is to increase listings with existing discount customers benefit from their store expansion plans and open new European accounts in this sector. 3. UK supermarkets We have longstanding trade relationships with all of the major UK supermarkets but our penetration to date has been relatively low. However we believe that our branded products competitively priced compared to the ownlabel equivalents are very appealing to supermarket customers. We provide supermarket retailers with the same retail margin as their ownlabel equivalent in addition to a more attractive proposition for their customers and plan to increase our penetration of the UK supermarkets by demonstrating the effectiveness of our product offer instore through increased LFL sales. 4. Online channels Online now accounts for over 20 of nonfood retail sales in the UK. In FY 17 online channels only accounted for 4.2 of our sales. We believe that there is significant opportunity for further growth through platforms such as Amazon and our objective is to grow this business to 20 of revenue over the medium to long term. In addition we believe that there may be further scope for growth via a roll out across Amazons other international platforms. www.upgs.com 12 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information UP Global Sourcing Holdings plc Key Performance Indicators The Board monitors the development of the measures below as highlevel indicators of performance.

The Directors are excited about the potential for the brand which now has listings in a number of retailers including a major supermarket from January 2018. Margins Gross margin was 160 bps lower than 2016 influenced by two key factors firstly FOB sales which typically generate lower gross margin but require lower overheads to serve increased from 60.2 of sales to 67.6 and secondly gross margin on landed sales whilst partially protected by existing hedging contracts were impacted by cost pressures from the fall in the US exchange rate with GBP after the Brexit referendum.

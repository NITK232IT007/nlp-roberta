Strategic Report Chairmans Statement OUR PURPOSE AND STRATEGY SCISYS began in 1980 believing in the opportunities for software. The SCISYS Group is a leading developer of IT solutions and services. We are dedicated to our mission of empowering leading organisations and agencies to achieve their goals by creating and delivering quality software solutions and services. We develop robust realworld application solutions and products and provide supporting services that create real business benefit to a wide range of customers in diverse markets. The SCISYS strategy has always been to invest in innovation and acquisition for longterm growth. OUR PURPOSE OUR VISION OUR VALUES OUR PRINCIPLES OUR MISSION SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 06 We believe that SCISYS is well positioned in the short to medium term and that our ESD division might even gain from the situation. Any impact is likely to be felt by our Space division albeit that the division has continued to win contracts in this current period of pre Brexit uncertainty which extend beyond the proposed Brexit date which is encouraging. The Board continues to explore a wide range of Brexit options. While we very much welcome the UK governments strong support for the UKs continued participation in EU funded space programmes EGNOS Galileo Copernicus and hope to see further clarity on this position during the negotiations for the transitionstage arrangements we are nevertheless preparing a range of tactical options including the option of redomiciling while retaining our AIM listing and associated UK tax benefits to mitigate the possible effects of Brexit on our Space business post March 2019 should negotiations not prove favourable.

The proposed final dividend will be paid on 27 July 2018 to shareholders on the register at 6 July 2018. The shares will go exdividend on 5 July 2018.

Governance matching our needs We are committed to high standards of corporate governance. We have strong governance frameworks in place throughout the Group in balance with our risks. SCISYS is currently compliant to the extent appropriate for a company of its size with the UK Corporate Governance Code and is looking to adopt the QCA Corporate Governance Code during the course of 2018. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE The key elements of the Groups strategy remain unchanged. We continue to focus on balanced revenue growth and margin improvement as well as managementcontrol of risk and succession planning. Outlook We are pleased with the healthy organic growth in revenues achieved in 2017. Our strong secondhalf trading performance combined with steadily reducing levels of net debt and a record yearend order book provides a solid platform to deliver further progress in 2018 and beyond. Based on current performance on projects and our order pipeline across the entire Group the Directors remain fully confident in the prospects of the Groups future organic growth. We will also continue to look for opportunity where there is a good market product and cultural fit to grow through acquisition.
